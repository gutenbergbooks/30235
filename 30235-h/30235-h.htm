<h2>TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.</h2>

<p>There is but one study more interesting than the history of literature,
and that is the study of literature itself. That the former should often
be mistaken for the latter is scarcely to be wondered at when we
consider the intimate and almost indivisible relationship existing
between them. Yet, in truth, they are as capable of separate
consideration as are music and the history of music.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anglo-Saxon Poetry.</div>

<p>Any careful investigation of the history of English poetry would
naturally begin at a point of time some six or seven hundred years
earlier than that of Chaucer. From such investigation we should learn
that even as early as the ninth century&mdash;perhaps, indeed, the
eighth&mdash;there were in England some composers of verse in the Anglo-Saxon
tongue; that the songs of these poets were chiefly of religion or of
war, and that being written in a language very different from our modern
English they can scarcely be considered as belonging properly to our
literature; that among them, however, is a noble poem, "Beowulf," the
oldest epic of any modern people, which was probably sung or recited by
pagan minstrels long before it was written down in permanent form; that,
after the conquest of England by the Normans, the early language of the
<span class="sidenote">The Transition Period.</span>English people underwent a long and tedious process of transition,&mdash;a
blending, in a certain sense, with the Latinized and more polished
tongue of their conquerors,&mdash;and that the result was the language which
we now call English and are proud to claim as our own; that it was about
three hundred years after the Norman Conquest, namely, in 1362, that
this new tongue was officially recognized and authorized to be used in
the courts at law throughout the land; and that about the same time
Geoffrey Chaucer composed and wrote his first poems. We should learn,
moreover, that, during the transition period mentioned above, there were
many attempts at writing poetry, resulting in the production of tedious
metrical romances (chiefly translated from the French) and interminable
rhyming chronicles, pleasing, of course, to the people of that time, but
wholly devoid of poetic <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[<a href="./images/5.png">5</a>]</span>excellence and unspeakably dull to modern
readers; that these poems, so called, were little better than rhymed
doggerels, written in couplets of eight-syllabled lines and having for
their subjects the miraculous deeds of saints and heroes and the
occurrence of supernatural or impossible phenomena; that the composers
of these metrical romances and chronicles, although giving free rein to
the imagination, were utterly destitute of poetic fancy and hence
produced no true poetry; that, nevertheless, some writer was now and
then inspired by a flash of real poetic fire, producing a few lines of
remarkable freshness and beauty,&mdash;little lyrics shining forth like gems
in the great mass of verbiage and rubbish and foretelling the glorious
possibilities which were to be realized in the future.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Piers Ploughman.</div>

<p>Continuing this most interesting study, we should learn that just at the
time that Chaucer was beginning the composition of his immortal works,
there appeared an allegorical poem of considerable length, so earnest in
tone, so richly imaginative, so full of picturesque descriptions, that
it seemed rather a fulfilment than a prophecy; that this poem&mdash;called
"The Vision of William concerning Piers Ploughman," and written by an
obscure monk whose name was probably William Langland&mdash;was the greatest
poem and the most popular that had ever been written in England, and yet
that it failed in many ways of being true English poetry: its metre was
irregular, and its rhythm was imperfect; its verses instead of rhyming
were constructed in accordance with certain rules of alliteration; its
subjects, while interesting, no doubt, to those for whom it was written,
were not such as bring into play the highest powers of the imagination
or incite the poetic fancy to its noblest flights. Then we should learn
that while the ink from good Langland's pen was yet scarcely dry after
his third revision of "Piers Ploughman," Geoffrey Chaucer came forward
with his sweet imaginings bodied in immortal verse, his tuneful numbers,
his "well of English undefiled,"&mdash;and English poetry, which now for more
than five centuries has been the chief glory of our literature, had its
true beginning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Three Schools of Poetry.</div>

<p>Pursuing the study on lines which would now be more distinctly marked,
we should observe that Chaucer's best poetry, as well as that of the
poets who followed him in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, was
distinguished by its truthfulness to nature, by its expression in hearty
and harmonious words of the finer emotions of the soul, and by the
freedom and elasticity of its versification. We should learn that in the
seventeenth century this style of poetry&mdash;sometimes called the
romantic&mdash;was succeeded by another and very different <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[<a href="./images/6.png">6</a>]</span>fashion in poetic
composition, introduced into England in imitation of continental and
classical models: that this new style of versification&mdash;ignoring nature
and making everything subservient to art&mdash;was purely artificial,
characterized by "an oratorical pomp, a classical correctness, a
theatrical dressing, abundance of moralizing"; and that, with Waller for
its sponsor and Dryden and Pope for its high priests, it remained for a
century and a half the favorite of the literary world, the model of
poetic diction, the standard of poetic taste. We should learn that,
towards the end of the eighteenth century, certain writers began to
perceive that although attention to artistic rules in composition may be
necessary to the best poetry, yet natural feeling, a cultivated
imagination, and a fancy unrestrained by merely arbitrary limitations
are even more indispensable; that these writers, rebelling against the
established order of things, taught that there are elements of true
poetry in the popular ballads of earlier times, that even the wearisome
metrical romances of the Middle Ages are rich in suggestiveness and in
materials for a nobler poetry, and that, instead of going to the
classics and to society for subjects and models, the poet may find them
in nature, in the life which is about him, and in a thousand sources
never before suspected. Finally, we should learn that, at the very time
when great revolutions in politics and philosophy were being
inaugurated, a new spirit thus began to manifest itself in our
literature,&mdash;a spirit of revolt against artificial restrictions and
traditional methods,&mdash;which produced a glorious revival in English
poetic composition and ushered in a third great school of poetry,
distinguished for its breadth and freedom, as that which it superseded
had been known for its elegance and precision.<a name="FNanchor_6:1_1" id="FNanchor_6:1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:1_1" class="fnanchor">[6:1]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The History of English Poetry.</div>

<p>A study of the development of English poetry such as we have outlined
above would involve a knowledge of the history of the English people and
of the various circumstances and events which from time to time
influenced our language and literature. It would also embrace many other
topics, biographical, philological, rhetorical, and speculative, which
have only a secondary relationship to the central idea of poetry. In
fact, it would be a study not of poetry, but about poetry,&mdash;of the
circumstances which suggested it, of the men who produced it, and of the
origin of the word-forms and methods of versification which distinguish
it. Such a study, altogether interesting and eminently profitable though
it be, should not be undertaken by any student until he has acquired an
extensive <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[<a href="./images/7.png">7</a>]</span>personal acquaintance with poetry itself. We may enjoy the
beautiful creations of Tennyson, of Shelley, of Burns, even of Chaucer,
without knowing one word of the history of poetry, without so much as
knowing the names of the writers or the circumstances under which they
wrote. But, on the other hand, to him who knows nothing of the
masterpieces of our literature, save at second hand, the history of
English letters must of necessity be dull, uninteresting, and often
unintelligible. While to him who has prepared himself for its study by
fitting himself for an appreciation of these noble creations and
becoming thoroughly imbued with their spirit, what a field of delightful
study does it offer!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Object of this Book.</div>

<p>The object of the present compilation is to aid in this preparatory
work,&mdash;that is, to offer a plan for promoting the study <span class="smcap">of</span> poetry before
the broader but less important study <span class="smcap">about</span> poetry is undertaken. To this
end we present for the student's consideration a few representative
poems written at different times and by men of widely different tastes
and talents during the six centuries which may be said to have elapsed
since the formation of the modern English tongue. Our chief aim is to
lead to such a study of these selections as shall help the reader to
perceive and appreciate their true poetic qualities and enter into full
sympathy with the thoughts and feelings which their writers intended to
express. <span class="sidenote">Methods of Study.</span> The first object to be sought in the study of these poems is
the perception of those characteristic excellences which have made them
universally admired and placed them among the classics of our language.
To accomplish this object rationally and successfully, it is best to
begin with those productions which are nearest to us in point of time
and which are more in harmony with our own thoughts, and therefore
easiest to understand and enjoy. An attempt to pursue these studies in
chronological order, beginning with the works of Chaucer and the older
poets, would oblige the student to encounter at the outset so many
purely mechanical difficulties that he would fail to discern the
spiritual qualities of truth, beauty, and goodness, which are the very
essence of all genuine poetry. He would very naturally acquire a
distaste for poetry long before he was able to understand it, and while
he might attain to some considerable knowledge of the history of
poetical literature, that literature itself would remain to him
practically a sealed book. Hence, in the study of this subject, as in
that of other branches, the true method is to present first that which
is the least difficult, to "proceed from the known to the unknown," to
begin with that which is near at hand and from <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[<a href="./images/8.png">8</a>]</span>it to proceed to the
consideration of things more remote. Not only are the most of Tennyson's
poems easily understood, but their beauty is readily apparent even to
the most superficial readers. By the time we have read and extracted all
the sweets from three or four of these, we shall be prepared to go a
step farther and undertake the study of Wordsworth's immortal
productions,&mdash;productions but little more difficult and but little less
poetic. Thus, step by step, we may review the six centuries of English
poetry which lie behind, and when at last we reach the time of Chaucer
we shall be able to take hold of his works with understanding and with
the zest which is begotten of true sympathy and appreciation. After the
book has been thus completed, it may be well to run through it again,
reversing the order of the lessons and this time considering the
subjects in strict chronological order. Our first study of the book will
have introduced us to English poetry, our second study of it will have
given us some insight into the history of its development.</p>

<p>It is well to remember, while pursuing this course, that a taste for
poetry is not acquired or fostered by an analysis of grammatical forms
or by any study of words merely as such. To analyze a puzzling sentence
or to trace the derivation of an interesting word to its roots sometimes
helps one to understand a difficult expression or to perceive in it a
meaning hitherto unsuspected; but to make the study of any selection
consist largely of exercises of this kind is to substitute grammar or
philology for literature. So, also, should it be borne in mind that
while it is often interesting and sometimes necessary to become
acquainted with certain details relative to the life of an author&mdash;the
date of his birth, the character of his education, the influences which
shaped his life and his work&mdash;yet such knowledge belongs to biography
and is in no sense literature. The study of authors should never be
substituted for the study of their works, and is usually profitable only
so far as it helps the student to understand the peculiarities which
distinguish those works and which are the result of certain personal
characteristics. And yet it is no uncommon thing to find students
acquainted with the minutest particulars in the lives of the great
writers, while of the masterpieces of thought and expression, which are
the glory of our literature, they betray a deplorable ignorance. Nor is
this the case with pupils at school alone. "For once that we take down a
Milton, and read a book of that 'voice,' as Wordsworth says, 'whose
sound is like the sea,' we take up fifty times a magazine with something
about Milton, or about Milton's grandmother, or a book stuffed with
curious facts <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[<a href="./images/9.png">9</a>]</span>about the houses in which he lived, and the juvenile
ailments of his first wife."<a name="FNanchor_9:1_2" id="FNanchor_9:1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_9:1_2" class="fnanchor">[9:1]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Practical Suggestions.</div>

<p>In the study of the selections contained in this volume, the following
method is recommended:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The piece should be thoroughly committed to memory.</p>

<p>2. It should be recited or read by each member of the class in such
manner as to bring out, if possible, his understanding of the meaning of
every passage.</p>

<p>3. Study the poem as a whole, and let each pupil point out the beauties
of thought or expression which distinguish it as a poetical composition.</p>

<p>4. Now study each stanza, or each independent thought, in its order, and
endeavor to understand each word or expression just as the poet intended
that it should be understood. The Notes appended to most of the
selections are intended rather to suggest the line of study in this
regard than to serve as exhaustive aids. The pupil should, so far as
possible, investigate for himself and make his own discoveries.
Questions concerning the derivation of words and the syntax of sentences
are to be discussed only so far as they will aid in the understanding of
some passage or of the piece as a whole.</p>

<p>5. Learn some of the most important facts connected with the author's
life. What were the conditions under which he wrote this piece? What was
the character of his education and of the other influences which shaped
his life and distinguished his works? Learn what some of the leading
critics have said concerning his works as a poet.</p>

<p>6. Finally, read the poem again, as a whole, and discuss its qualities
as a work of literary art, and again point out its distinctive beauties
and characteristic excellences.</p>

<p>The extracts given at the beginning of each Century will serve to keep
in mind the leading peculiarities which distinguished the poetry of each
period; and the lists of poets and their works will be found valuable
for purposes of reference. Before beginning the study of the selections
both teacher and pupils should read this Introduction carefully.</p>

<h2>The Nineteenth Century.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<i>Now appeared the English romantic school, a sect of 'dissenters in
poetry,' who spoke out aloud, kept themselves close together, and
repelled settled minds by the audacity and novelty of their theories.
They had violently broken with tradition, and leaped over all classical
culture, to take their models from the Renaissance and the middle-age.
They sought, in the old national ballads and ancient poetry of foreign
lands, the fresh and primitive accent which had been wanting in
classical literature, and whose presence seemed to them to be a sign of
truth and beauty. They proposed to adapt to poetry the ordinary language
of conversation, such as is spoken in the middle and lower classes, and
to replace studied phrases and a lofty vocabulary by natural tones and
plebeian words. In place of the classic mould, they tried stanzas,
sonnets, ballads, blank verse, with the roughness and subdivisions of
the primitive poets.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Some had culled gigantic legends, piled up
dreams, ransacked the East, Greece, Arabia, the Middle Ages, and
overloaded the human imagination with hues and fancies from every clime.
Others had buried themselves in metaphysics and moral philosophy, had
mused indefatigably on the condition of man, and spent their lives on
the sublime and the monotonous. Others, making a medley of crime and
heroism, had conducted, through darkness and flashes of lightning, a
train of contorted and terrible figures, desperate with remorse,
relieved by their grandeur. Men wanted to rest after so many efforts and
so much success. On the going out of the imaginative, sentimental, and
Satanic school, Tennyson appeared exquisite. All the forms and ideas
which had pleased them were found in him, but purified, modulated, set
in a splendid style. He completed an age.</i>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Taine.</span></p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>This poem was written in 1832. Considered as a picture, or as a series
of pictures, its beauty is unsurpassed. The story which is here so
briefly told is founded upon a touching legend connected with the
romance of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. Tennyson
afterwards (in 1859) expanded it into the <i>Idyll</i> called "Elaine,"
wherein he followed more closely the original narrative as related by
Sir Thomas Malory.</p>

<p>Sir Lancelot was the strongest and bravest of the Knights of the Round
Table, and for him Elaine, "the fair maid of Astolat," conceived a
hopeless passion. "Her love was platonic and pure as that of a child,
but it was masterful in its strength." Having learned that Lancelot was
pledged to celibacy, she pined away and died. But before her death she
called her brother, and having dictated a letter which he was to write,
she spake thus:</p>

<p>"'While my body is whole, let this letter be put into my right hand, and
my hand bound fast with the letter until I be cold, and let me be put in
a fair bed with all my richest clothes that I have about me, and so let
my bed and all my rich clothes be laid with me in a chariot to the next
place whereas the Thames is, and there let me be put in a barge, and but
one man with me, such as ye trust to steer me thither, and that my barge
be covered with black samite over and over.' .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So when she was dead,
the corpse and the bed and all was led the next way unto the Thames, and
there all were put in a barge on the Thames, and so the man steered the
barge to Westminster, and there he rowed a great while to and fro, or
any man espied."<a name="FNanchor_23:A_3" id="FNanchor_23:A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_23:A_3" class="fnanchor">[23:A]</a> At length the King and his Knights, coming down
to the waterside, and seeing the boat and the lily maid of Astolat, they
uplifted the hapless body of Elaine, and bore it to the hall.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But Arthur spied the letter in her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Stoopt, took, brake seal, and read it; this was all:<br /></span>

<span class="i0i">I, sometime called the maid of Astolat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Come, for you left me taking no farewell,<br /></span>

<p>And so the maid was buried, "not as one unknown, nor meanly, but with
gorgeous obsequies, and mass and rolling music, like a queen. And the
story of her dolorous voyage was blazoned on her tomb in letters gold
and azure."</p>

Ballin's sword was put into marble stone, standing it upright as a great
millstone, and it swam down the stream to the city of Camelot, that is,
in English, Wincheste." There was another Camelot, also King Arthur's
capital, on the river Camel, in Cornwall, to which Shakespeare makes
reference in <i>King Lear</i>, II, ii. Tennyson, in "Gareth and Lynette,"
describes the appearance of the city when approached in the early
morning:</p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>This little lyric forms a part of "an idyl" of the same title, published
in 1855. The poet introduces it in the following manner:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here, by this brook, we parted; I to the East<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And he to Italy&mdash;too late&mdash;too late:<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. Yet the brook he loved<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. seems, as I re-listen to it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Prattling the primrose fancies of the boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">To me that loved him; for, 'O brook,' he says,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">'O babbling brook,' says Edmund in his rhyme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">'Whence come you?' and the brook, why not? replies:<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">'I come from haunts of coot and hern,'" etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In reading this poem, observe how strikingly the sound is made to
correspond to the sense.</p>

<h3>NOTE.</h3>

<p>"Thence for nine whole days was I borne by ruinous winds over the
teeming deep; but on the tenth day we set foot on the land of the
lotus-eaters, who eat a flowery food. So we stepped ashore and drew
water, and straightway my company took their mid-day meal by the swift
ships. Now when we had tasted meat and drink, I sent forth certain of my
company to go and make search of what manner of men they were who here
live upon the earth by bread, and I chose out two of my fellows, and
sent a third with them as herald. Then straightway they went and mixed
with the men of the lotus-eaters, and so it was that the lotus-eaters
devised not death for our fellows, but gave them of the lotus to taste.
Now whosoever of them did eat the honey-sweet fruit of the lotus, had no
more wish to bring tidings nor to come back, but there he chose to abide
with the lotus-eating men, ever feeding on the lotus, and forgetful of
his homeward way. Therefore I led them back to the ships weeping, and
sore against their will, and dragged them beneath the benches, and bound
them in the hollow barques. But I commanded the rest of my well-loved
company to make speed and go on board the swift ships, lest haply any
should eat of the lotus and be forgetful of returning."&mdash;<i>Homer's
Odyssey</i>, ix, 80.</p>

<p>"In this poem, 'The Lotos-Eaters,' the artistic ideal of the young poet
(it was written in 1830) found its most finished expression and its
culminating point. Here he seems to have attained a consciousness that
beyond the ideal which he had adopted there is another, larger, grander,
and more satisfying. Nowhere else, perhaps, in the range of poetry, is
the trance of a listless life so harmoniously married to appropriate
melodies and appropriate accompaniments."&mdash;<i>North British Review.</i></p>

<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Alfred Tennyson</span> was born at Somersby, Lincolnshire, England, in 1809.
His early education was received at home from his father, who was rector
of Somersby and vicar of Bennington and Grimsby. He was afterwards sent
to Trinity College, Cambridge, where, at the age of twenty, he received
the chancellor's medal for a poem in blank verse, entitled "Timbuctoo."
In 1830 he published a small volume of "Poems chiefly Lyrical." A
revised edition of this volume, published in 1833, contained "The Lady
of Shalott," "The Lotos-Eaters," and others of his best-known short
poems. In 1850, upon the death of Wordsworth, he was appointed
poet-laureate. In the same year he was married to Emily, daughter of
Henry Sellwood, Esq., and niece of Sir John Franklin. Since 1851,
Tennyson has resided for the greater part of the time at Farringford,
Freshwater, Isle of Wight. In December, 1883, he was made Baron Tennyson
of Aldworth and Freshwater.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tennyson," says R. H. Hutton, "was an artist even before he was a
poet; in other words, the eye for beauty, grace, and harmony of effect
was even more emphatically one of his original gifts than the voice for
poetic utterance itself. This, probably, it is which makes his very
earliest pieces appear so full of effort, and sometimes even so full of
affectation. They were elaborate attempts to embody what he saw, before
the natural voice of the poet had come to him. I think it possible to
trace not only a pre-poetic period in his art, but to date the period at
which the soul was 'infused' into his poetry, and the brilliant external
figures became the dwelling-places of germinating poetic thoughts
creating their own music. Curiously enough, the first poem where there
is any trace of those musings of the Round Table to which he has
directed so much of his maturest genius, is also a confession that the
poet was sick of the magic mirror of fancy and its picture-shadows, and
was turning away from them to the poetry of human life. Whenever Mr.
Tennyson's pictorial fancy has had it in any degree in its power to run
away with the guiding and controlling mind, the richness and the
workmanship have to some extent overgrown the spiritual principle of his
poems. It is obvious, for instance, that even in relation to natural
scenery, what his poetical faculty delights in most are rich, luxuriant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[<a href="./images/36.png">36</a>]</span>landscapes, in which either nature or man has accumulated a lavish
variety of effects. It is in the scenery of the mill, the garden, the
chase, the down, the rich pastures, the harvest-field, the palace
pleasure-grounds, the Lord of Burleigh's fair domains, the luxuriant
sylvan beauty, bearing testimony to the careful hand of man, 'the summer
crisp with shining woods,' that Mr. Tennyson most delights. If he strays
to rarer scenes, it is almost in search of richer and more luxuriant
loveliness, like the tropical splendors of 'Enoch Arden' and the
enervating skies which cheated the Lotos-Eaters of their longing for
home."</p>

<p>"Mr. Tennyson," says a writer in the <i>North British Review</i>, "deserves
an especial study, not only as a poet, but as a leader and a landmark of
popular thought and feeling. As a poet, he belongs to the highest
category of English writers; for poetry is the strongest and most
vigorous branch of English literature. In this literature his works are
evidently destined to secure a permanent place; for they express in
language refined and artistic, but not unfamiliar, a large segment of
the popular thought of the period over which they range. He has,
moreover, a clearly marked if not strongly individualized style, which
has served as a model for imitators, and as a starting-point for poets
who have sought to improve upon it."</p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>"This was composed," says Wordsworth, "during my residence at Town-End,
Grasmere (1803-1806). Two years at least passed between the writing of
the first four stanzas and the remaining part. To the attentive and
competent reader the whole sufficiently explains itself, but there may
be no harm in adverting here to particular feelings or experiences of my
own mind on which the structure of the poem partly rests. Nothing was
more difficult for me in childhood than to admit the notion of death as
a state applicable to my own being. I have said elsewhere:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5h">'A simple child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lightly draws its breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feels its life in every limb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What should it know of death?'<a name="FNanchor_44:A_5" id="FNanchor_44:A_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_44:A_5" class="fnanchor">[44:A]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"But it was not so much from the source of animal vivacity that <i>my</i>
difficulty came, as from a sense of the indomitableness of the spirit
within me. I used to brood over the stories of Enoch and Elijah, and
almost persuade myself that, whatever might become of others, I should
be translated in something of the same way to heaven. With a feeling
congenial to this, I was often unable to think of external things as
having external existence, and I communed with all that I saw as
something not apart from, but inherent in, my own immaterial nature.
Many times while going to school have I grasped at a wall or tree to
recall myself from this abyss of idealism to reality. At that time I was
afraid of mere processes. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[<a href="./images/45.png">45</a>]</span>In later periods of life I have deplored, as
we have all reason to do, a subjugation of an opposite character, and
have rejoiced over the remembrances, as is expressed in the lines,
<i>Obstinate questionings</i>, etc. To that dream-like vividness and splendor
which invests objects of sight in childhood every one, I believe, if he
could look back, could bear testimony, and I need not dwell upon it
here; but having in the poem regarded it as a presumptive evidence of a
prior state of existence, I think it right to protest against a
conclusion which has given pain to some good and pious persons, that I
meant to inculcate such a belief. It is far too shadowy a notion to be
recommended to faith as more than an element in our instincts of
immortality. But let us bear in mind that, though the idea is not
advanced in Revelation, there is nothing there to contradict it, and the
fall of man presents an analogy in its favor. Accordingly, a
pre-existent state has entered into the popular creeds of many nations,
and among all persons acquainted with classic literature is known as an
ingredient in Platonic philosophy. Archimedes said that he could move
the world if he had a point whereon to rest his machine. Who has not
felt the same aspirations as regards the world of his mind? Having to
wield some of its elements when I was impelled to write this poem on the
'Immortality of the Soul,' I took hold of the notion of pre-existence as
having sufficient foundation in humanity for authorizing me to make for
my purpose the best use of it I could as a poet."</p>

<p>Lord Houghton says of this poem: "If I am asked what is the greatest
poem in the English language, I never for a moment hesitate to say,
Wordsworth's 'Ode on the Intimations of Immortality.'"</p>

<p>Principal Shairp says: "'The Ode on Immortality' marks the highest limit
which the tide of poetic inspiration has reached in England within this
century, or indeed since the days of Milton."</p>

<p>The idea of the pre-existence of the soul had already been treated by
Henry Vaughan in "Silex Scintillans" (1655).</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Happy those infant days, when I<br /></span>

<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">William Wordsworth</span> was born at Cockermouth, a town in Cumberland,
England, April 7, 1770. He went to school at Hawkshead, Lancashire,
whence in his seventeenth year he was sent to St. John's College,
Cambridge. In January, 1791, he took his degree at the University, but
without having distinguished himself in any way. The next fifteen or
sixteen months were spent in France, just then in the first wild hopes
of the Revolution. "In the aspirations and hopes of the revolutionists
he was an ardent sharer; he thought that the world's great age was
beginning anew; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[<a href="./images/53.png">53</a>]</span>and with all his soul he hailed so splendid an era. The
ultimate degradation of that great movement by wild lawlessness, and
then by most selfish ambition, alienated his sympathy for it." Towards
the close of 1792 he returned to England, and passed the subsequent time
among his friends in London and elsewhere till he settled with his
sister at Racedown, Dorsetshire, in 1796. In the following year they
removed to Alfoxden. It was during this period that he made the
acquaintance of Coleridge. Wordsworth had already published (1793) two
little volumes of poetry, entitled <i>Descriptive Sketches</i> and <i>The
Evening Walk</i>; but they showed little promise of the triumphs which were
to crown his later life. In 1798 the first volume of the <i>Lyrical
Ballads</i> was published at Bristol, which purported to be the joint work
of himself and Mr. Coleridge, but to which the latter contributed only
"The Ancient Mariner" and two or three shorter poems. After some months
spent in Germany, Wordsworth and his sister established themselves at
Grasmere, in the lake country. In 1800 he published the second volume of
the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>, and in 1802 he married Mary Hutchinson. From 1799
to 1814 he was mainly busy with his great philosophical poem, to be
called "The Recluse," "containing views of Man, Nature, and Society," of
which "The Prelude" was to be the introduction and "The Excursion" the
Second and main Part. He designed that his minor pieces should be so
arranged in connection with this work as to "give them claim to be
likened to the little cells, oratories, and sepulchral recesses,
ordinarily included in Gothic churches." This plan, however, was never
carried out, as of the First and Third Parts only one book was written,
and it has never been published. From 1814 until his death Wordsworth
lived serenely and quietly at Rydal Mount, making occasional excursions
into Scotland and Wales, and a tour upon the continent. In 1843, upon
the death of Southey, he was appointed Poet-Laureate. His life was a
long one, of steady work and much happiness. He died April 23, 1850.</p>

<p>The distinguishing feature of Wordsworth's poetry is well set forth in
his own words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The moving accident is not my trade,<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">To freeze the blood I have no ready arts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">'Tis my delight, alone in summer shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">To pipe a simple song for thinking hearts."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[<a href="./images/54.png">54</a>]</span>
"Every great poet," he said, "is a teacher; I wish either to be
considered as a teacher or as nothing."</p>

<p>And he avowed that the purpose of his poetry was "to console the
afflicted; to add sunshine to daylight by making the happy happier; to
teach the young and the gracious of every age <i>to see, to think and
feel</i>, and therefore to become more actively and securely virtuous."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Love had he found in huts where poor men lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">His daily teachings had been woods and rills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The silence that is in the starry sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">The sleep that is among the lonely hills."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Wordsworth," says John Campbell Shairp, "was the first who, both in
theory and practice, shook off the trammels of the so-called poetic
diction which had tyrannized over English poetry for more than a
century. This diction of course exactly represented the half-courtly,
half-classical mode of thinking and feeling. As Wordsworth rebelled
against this conventionality of spirit, so against the outward
expression of it. The whole of the stock phrases and used-up metaphors
he discarded, and returned to living language of natural feeling, as it
is used by men, instead of the dead form of it which had got stereotyped
in books. And just as in his subjects he had taken in from the waste
much virgin soil, so in his diction he appropriated for poetic use a
large amount of words, idioms, metaphors, till then by the poets

the most part, very models of natural, powerful, and yet sensitive
English; the language being, like a garment, woven out of, and

<h3>NOTES</h3>

<p>The first part of the unfinished poem, "Christabel," was written in
1797, the second part which, however, left the story apparently as
incomplete as before, in 1808. The two parts were first published in
1816. The poem is a picture of white innocence, purity, and truth,
pursued and persecuted by the powers of evil. Its incompleteness seems
to enhance its interest. "Completion could scarcely have failed to
lessen its reality, for the reader could not have endured, neither could
the poet's own theory have endured, the sacrifice of Christabel, the
triumph of evil over good; and had she triumphed, there is a vulgar
well-being in victory which has nothing to do with such a strain."</p>

<p>"Such is the unfinished and unfinishable tale of Christabel&mdash;a poem
which, despite its broken notes and over-brevity, has raised its author
to the highest rank of poets, and which in itself is at once one of the
sweetest, loftiest, most spiritual utterances that has ever been framed
in English words. We know of no existing poem in any language to which
we can compare it. It stands by itself exquisite, celestial,
ethereal,&mdash;a song of the spheres,&mdash;yet full of such pathos and
tenderness and sorrowful beauty as only humanity can
give."&mdash;<i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, 1871.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[<a href="./images/65.png">65</a>]</span>
It is worthy of note that "Christabel" was the immediate inspiration of
Scott's "Lay of the Last Minstrel." "It is to Mr. Coleridge," says Sir
Walter, "that I am bound to make the acknowledgment due from the pupil
to his master." "But certainly," says Hales, "Scott himself never
succeeded in surrounding any one of his works with so fine an atmosphere
of glamour and romance."</p>

<p>The language and metrical arrangement of this poem are not only peculiar
but are in full accord with the weird and fantastic conception of the
piece as a whole. The versification is based upon a principle not
commonly practised&mdash;that of counting the number of accentuated words in
a line instead of the number of syllables. Though the latter varies from
seven to twelve, yet in each line the accents never exceed four. The
result is an irregular, but strangely beautiful harmony of a kind that
can hardly be attained through the ordinary methods of versification.</p>

<p>This poem is to be studied for its exquisite beauty, for the true poetic
qualities which it possesses and which distinguish it from mere verse.
Hence, no explanatory notes are given with reference to any particular
passage, nor is it desirable that it should be analyzed with a view to
grammatical or philological study. It should be read and reread until
the student is thoroughly in accord with the poetic spirit which
breathes in and vivifies the entire production. "It was indolence, no
doubt, that left the tale half told&mdash;indolence and misery&mdash;and a poetic
instinct higher than all the better impulses of industry and virtuous
gain. The subject by its very nature was incomplete; it had to be left a
lovely, weird suggestion&mdash;a vision for every eye that could see."</p>


<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</span> was born at Ottery Saint Mary, October 21, 1772.
He was educated at Christ's Hospital and at Jesus College, Cambridge. At
the age of twenty-two he left the University without having taken a
degree. He was an intimate friend of Charles Lamb and Southey, and with
the latter formed a wild scheme for the founding of a "Pantisocratic
State" in America, which, however, was soon abandoned. His first book of
poetry was published in 1794. In 1796 he and Charles Lamb published a
volume of poems together. He soon afterwards became acquainted with
Wordsworth, and in 1798 the two brought out their famous volume of
<i>Lyrical Ballads</i>, containing some of Wordsworth's best <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[<a href="./images/66.png">66</a>]</span>pieces and
Coleridge's "Ancient Mariner." "Christabel," after lying in manuscript
for several years, was published in 1816, three editions being issued
within twelve months. Coleridge's chief poems were published in 1817 in
a collection entitled <i>Sibylline Leaves</i>, so called, he says, "in
allusion to the fragmentary and wildly scattered state in which they had
long been suffered to remain." At about the same time he was received
into the house of Mr. Gillman, a surgeon residing at Highgate, in order
to be cured if possible of his excessive use of opium. Here he produced
his more important prose works, <i>Aids to Reflection</i>, and <i>On the
Constitution of Church and State</i>; and here he died, July 25, 1834.</p>

<p>Coleridge was forever planning and designing,&mdash;beginning a work and
leaving its completion until to-morrow&mdash;which never came. He devoted his
attention only sparingly to poetry&mdash;and that chiefly during his youth.
Later in life he was occupied with political, social, and religious
questions. "He was a living Hamlet, full of the most splendid thoughts
and the noblest purposes, but a most incompetent doer." "His mind,"
wrote Southey, "is a perpetual St. Vitus's dance&mdash;eternal activity
without action."</p>

<p>"Of Coleridge's best verses," says Swinburne, "I venture to affirm that
the world has nothing like them, and can never have; that they are of
the highest kind, and of their own. They are jewels of the diamond's
price, flowers of the rose's rank, but unlike any rose or diamond
known."</p>

<p>"His best work is but little," says Stopford Brooke, "but of its kind it
is perfect and unique.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. All that he did excellently might be bound up
in twenty pages, but it should be bound in pure gold."</p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>This is perhaps the most perfect lyric of its kind in the English
language. Every verse is worthy of careful study, and it should be read
and reread until its exquisite melody is felt and the subtle thoughts
which it <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[<a href="./images/71.png">71</a>]</span>embodies fully understood. Yet there is little in the poem
which requires annotation&mdash;the lark's song itself admits of no
explanation.</p>

<p>"For sweetness the 'Ode to a Skylark' is inferior only to Coleridge, in
rapturous passion to no man. It is like the bird it
sings,&mdash;enthusiastic, enchanting, profuse, continuous, and
alone,&mdash;small, but filling the heavens."&mdash;<i>Leigh Hunt.</i></p>

<p>"Has any one, since Shakespeare and Spenser, lighted on such tender and
such grand ecstasies?"&mdash;<i>Taine.</i></p>

<p>The skylark is very generally distributed over the northern portions of
the Old World, but is not found in America. Its song in the morning may
often be heard when the bird is so high as to be entirely out of sight,
and although not finely modulated is remarkably cheerful and prolonged.
A person who is accustomed to the song can tell by its variations
whether it be ascending, stationary, or descending.</p>

his reeds music not to be excelled by that of the sweetest singing

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>"A clever but disreputable professor at Pisa one day related to Shelley
the sad story of a beautiful and noble lady, the Contessina Emilia
Viviani, who had been confined by her father in a dismal convent of the
suburbs, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[<a href="./images/79.png">79</a>]</span>to await her marriage with a distasteful husband." Shelley,
fired as ever by a tale of tyranny, was eager to visit the fair captive.
The professor accompanied him and Medwin to the convent parlor, where
they found her more lovely than even the most glowing descriptions had
led them to expect. Nor was she only beautiful. Shelley soon discovered
that she had "cultivated her mind beyond what I have ever met with in
Italian women"; and a rhapsody composed by her upon the subject of
Uranian Love&mdash;"Il Vero Amore"&mdash;justifies the belief that she possessed
an intellect of more than ordinary elevation. He took Mrs. Shelley to
see her; and both did all they could to make her convent prison less
irksome by frequent visits, by letters, by presents of flowers and
books. It was not long before Shelley's sympathy for this unfortunate
lady took the form of love, which, however spiritual and Platonic, was
not the less passionate. The result was the composition of
"Epipsychidion," the most unintelligible of all his poems to those who
have not assimilated the spirit of Plato's <i>Symposium</i> and Dante's <i>Vita
Nuova</i>.&mdash;<i>J. A. Symonds.</i></p>

<p>W. M. Rossetti characterizes this poem as "a pure outpouring of poetry;
a brimming and bubbling fountain of freshness and music, magical with
its own spray rainbows."</p>

<p>A year after its composition, Shelley wrote: "The 'Epipsychidion' I
cannot look at. If you are curious, however, to hear what I am and have
been, it will tell you something thereof. It is an idealized history of
my life and feelings."</p>

<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy Bysshe Shelley</span> was born at Field Place, near Horsham in Sussex,
August 4, 1792. He was educated at Eton and at Oxford. While a student
at the latter place, he wrote a pamphlet, entitled <i>The Necessity of
Atheism</i>, which caused his expulsion from college. This occurred in
1811, and in the same year he married Harriet Westbrook, from whom,
three years later, he separated. In 1816 he married Mary Godwin. In 1818
he left England for Italy, where he remained until his death by drowning
in the gulf of Spezia, July 8, 1822. His first considerable poem, "Queen
Mab," was published in 1813; "Alastor, or the Spirit of Solitude," in
1816; "The Revolt of Islam," in 1818; and "Epipsychidion" and "Adonais"
in 1821. His two dramas, the "Cenci" and "Prometheus Unbound," were
issued, the former in 1819, the latter in 1821.</p>

<p>"Shelley's early rupture with the English world," says Hales, "lost him
all the advantages which a fuller experience of it and a longer
intercourse with it might have given. That world was no less estranged
from him than he from it. It misunderstood and misinterpreted him
throughout his career. It covered him with its opprobrium. Assuredly, he
was not the man that world painted. It by no means follows that because
Shelley did not repeat the ordinary creeds, and even mocked at them,
that he believed nothing. Shelley was never in his soul an atheist: it
was simply impossible with his nature that he should be; what he did
deny and defy was a deity whose worship seemed, as he saw the world,
consistent with the reign of selfishness and bigotry."</p>

<p>Lord Macaulay says: "We doubt whether any modern poet has possessed in
an equal degree some of the highest qualities of the great ancient
masters. The words <i>bard</i> and <i>inspiration</i>, which seem so cold and
affected when applied to other modern writers, have a perfect propriety
when applied to him. He was not an author, but a bard. His poetry seems
not to have been an art, but an inspiration. Had he lived to the full
age of man, he might not improbably, have given to the world some great
work of the very highest rank in design and execution."</p>

<p>Leigh Hunt says: "Assuredly, had he lived, he would have been the
greatest dramatic writer since the days of Elizabeth. In general, if
Coleridge is the sweetest of our poets, Shelley is at once the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[<a href="./images/82.png">82</a>]</span>ethereal and most gorgeous&mdash;the one who has clothed his thoughts in
draperies of the most evanescent and most magnificent words and imagery.
His poetry is as full of mountains, seas, and skies, of light, and
darkness, and the seasons, and all the elements of our being, as if
Nature herself had written it, with the Creation and its hopes newly
cast around her, not, it must be confessed, without too indiscriminate a
mixture of great and small, and a want of sufficient shade&mdash;a certain
chaotic brilliancy, 'dark with excess of light.'"</p>

<p>Another English poet says: "Shelley outsang all poets on record but some
two or three throughout all time; his depths and heights of inner and
outer music are as divine as nature's, and not sooner exhaustible. He
was alone the perfect singing-god; his thoughts, words, deeds, all sang
together."</p>

<p>"The poet who creates a new ideal, and fills men's hearts with the flame
of a divine desire, is a practical force in the stream of human
development&mdash;and this Shelley has done. So much of his poetry is full of
the tender melancholy of the moonlight he loved, that the world is still
half blind to his highest bardic character, as the poet of a spiritual
dawn, the eager spirit who flies forward&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Calling the laps&egrave;d soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And weeping in the morning dew."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Even his moonlight seems to reflect the beams of some unrisen sun; and
his sunlight has all the ethereal exhilaration of that of the first
hours of a glorious day."&mdash;<i>John Todhunter.</i></p>

<p>"This poem," says Leigh Hunt, "was written in a house at the foot of
Highgate Hill, on the border of the fields looking towards Hampstead.
The poet had then his mortal illness upon him, and knew it; never was
the voice of death sweeter."</p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>"The Eve of St. Agnes" is one of the finest of Keats's shorter poems.
Leigh Hunt describes it as "the most complete specimen of his genius;
exquisitely loving; young, but full-grown poetry of the rarest
description; graceful as the beardless Apollo; glowing and gorgeous with
the colors of romance." The stanzas here quoted, while comprising the
main portion of the story, are not quite half of the entire poem.</p>

<p>Madeline, the beautiful daughter of a rude and rich old baron, is
secretly betrothed to Porphyro, a young man whom her father has sworn to
slay. On the eve of St. Agnes a great feast is in progress in the
baron's castle. Porphyro, at the risk of his life, "comes across the
moors, with heart on fire for Madeline." With the aid of the old nurse,
Angela, he gains admission into the castle and is concealed in a closet,
where he conceives the plan for their elopement. In the meanwhile,
Madeline, having danced with her father's guests, retires to her room,
her mind full of the thought of Porphyro, and intent upon testing the
truth of the belief, then current, that on this evening, maidens might,
if they performed certain ceremonies and forms, be vouchsafed a sight of
their future husbands.</p>

<p>St. Agnes was a young virgin of Palermo, who is said to have suffered
martyrdom at the age of thirteen, in the Diocletian persecution, about
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 304. Her feast was celebrated on the 21st of January.</p>

<p>With reference to the versification of this poem, see what is said of
the Spenserian stanza, page <a href="#Page_232">232</a>. There are many imitations of Spenser in
these verses.</p>

<p>The student is desired to discover for himself the peculiarities of
thought, of feeling, of expression, which give interest and beauty to
this production. The following are a few of the words and expressions
whose meaning he should study: "Gules"; "taint"; "vespers"; "poppied";
"Swart Paynims"; "Noiseless as fear in a wide wilderness"; "Morphean
amulet"; "affray"; "azure-lidded sleep"; "argosy"; "missal"; "tinct";
"Fez"; "Samarcand"; "Lebanon"; "eremite"; "witless"; "alarum"; "entoiled
in woofed phantasies"; "La belle dame sans mercy"; "heart-shaped and
vermeil dyed"; "Of haggard seeming"; "arras."</p>


<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">John Keats</span> was born October 29, 1795, in Moorfields, London. He was sent
to school at Enfield, where he gained the rudiments of a classical
education; but, his father having died when John was a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[<a href="./images/94.png">94</a>]</span>mere child, he
was apprenticed at an early age to a surgeon in Edmonton. When seventeen
years old a copy of Spenser's "Faerie Queene" fell into his hands, and
the perusal of that great poem was the beginning, for him, of a new
life. He felt the poetic instinct within him, and resolved that he too
would be a poet. In 1817 he published a small volume of poems, which
attracted but little attention; and in 1818 his more ambitious effort,
"Endymion," was presented to the world. The latter poem was unkindly
received by the great reviews. The author was advised to "go back to his
gallipots," and told that "a starved apothecary was better than a
starved poet." A story was long current that these severe criticisms
induced Keats's early death, but this is entirely improbable. He
continued writing, although consumption, a hereditary disease in his
family, had already begun its work upon him. He published "The Eve of
St. Agnes" in 1820, and had made some progress with a noble poem,
entitled "Hyperion," which Lord Byron declared to be "actually inspired
by the Titans, and as sublime as &AElig;schylus." In September of that year he
sailed for Italy, but the hope of prolonging life by a change of climate
proved to be vain. On the 27th of February, 1821, he died at Rome.</p>

<p>"We can hardly be wrong in believing," says Masson, "that had Keats
lived to the ordinary age of man, he would have been one of the greatest
of all our poets. As it is, I believe we shall all be disposed to place
him very near indeed to our very best."</p>

<p>"That which was deepest in his mind," says Stopford Brooke, "was the
love of loveliness for its own sake, the sense of its rightful and
pre-eminent power; and, in the singleness of worship which he gave to
Beauty, Keats is especially the artist, and the true father of the
latest modern school of poetry."</p>

<h2>The Eighteenth Century.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<i>The influence of the poetry of the past lasted; new elements were
added to poetry, and new forms of it took shape. The study of the Greek
and Latin classics revived, and with it a more artistic poetry. Not only
correct form, for which Pope sought, but beautiful form was sought
after. Men like Thomas Gray and William Collins strove to pour into
their work that simplicity of beauty which the Greek poets and Italians
like Petrarca had reached as the last result of genius restrained by
art.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Two things had been learned. First, that artistic rules were
necessary, and, secondly, that natural feeling was necessary in order
that poetry should have a style fitted to express nobly the emotions and
thoughts of man. The way was therefore now made ready for a style in
which the Art should itself be Nature, and it sprang at once into being
in the work of the poets of this time. The style of Gray is polished to
the finest point, and yet it is instinct with natural feeling. Goldsmith
is natural even to simplicity, and yet his verse is even more accurate
than Pope's. Cowper's style, in such poems as the 'Lines to my Mother's
Picture,' arises out of the simplest pathos, and yet it is as pure in
expression as Greek poetry.</i>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Stopford Brooke.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<i>At last there started up an unfortunate Scotch peasant (Burns),
rebelling against the world, and in love, with the yearnings, lusts,
greatness, and irrationality of modern genius. Now and then behind his
plough, he lighted on genuine verses, verses such as Heine and Alfred de
Musset have written in our own days. In those few words, combined after
a new fashion, there was a revolution.</i>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Taine.</span></p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>This poem, composed in 1785, is written partly in the Scottish dialect,
partly in English. The livelier passages are in the poet's vernacular;
the loftier or more solemn parts in the language of books. This
distinction <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[<a href="./images/104.png">104</a>]</span>was doubtless made because Burns disliked to treat his
higher themes in a merely colloquial manner, fearing to belittle them by
so doing. The household described was probably that of the poet's own
father; it was at least a typical Scotch peasant's household, with which
no one was more familiar. Gilbert Burns, in a letter to Dr. Currie,
says: "Although the 'Cotter' in the Saturday Night, is an exact copy of
my father in his manners, his family devotions, and exhortations, yet
the other parts of the description do not apply to our family. None of
us ever went 'At service out amang the neibors roun'.' Instead of our
depositing our 'sair-won penny-fee' with our parents, my father labored
hard, and lived with the most rigid economy, that he might be able to
keep his children at home."</p>

<p>The influence of Gray and Goldsmith is very apparent in more than one
passage in this poem.</p>

<p>"Robert had frequently remarked to me," said his brother, "that there
was something particularly venerable in the phrase, 'Let us worship
God,' used by a decent, sober head of a family introducing family
worship. To this sentiment of the author, the world is indebted for 'The
Cotter's Saturday Night.' The hint of the plan and title of the poem is
taken from Ferguson's 'Farmer's Ingle.'"</p>

Bosworth, "was the first kind of property; and, by bartering, this word

<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert Burns</span> was born in Ayrshire, Scotland, in 1759. His childhood and
youth were spent in poverty on his father's farm, where he learned to
plough, reap, mow, and thresh in the barn, but where opportunities for
education were such only as Scottish peasants know. In 1784 his father
died, and he attempted to manage a farm of his own at Mossgiel. The
experiment proving to be a failure, he resolved to leave Scotland, and
secured an appointment to a clerkship in Jamaica. Just before the time
set for his departure, he learned of the success of a volume of his
poems which had just been published at Kilmarnock; and, instead of
departing for the West Indies, he made a visit to Edinburgh. He was
welcomed by the best society, and received at once into the literary
circles of the Scottish capital. "His name and fame flashed like
sunshine over the land: the shepherd on the hill, the maiden at her
wheel, learned his songs by heart, and the first scholars of Scotland
courted his acquaintance." A second edition of his poems was published
in 1787, and with the proceeds&mdash;about $2500&mdash;he took a farm at
Ellisland, in Nithsdale. But his habits were such that he made sad
failure a second time in the experiment of farming; and, after two years
of mismanagement, to eke out his scanty income he accepted an
appointment as exciseman. In 1791, "unfortunately both for his health
and for his reputation," he removed to Dumfries, where, five years
later, he died.</p>

<p>"While the Shakespeares and Miltons roll on like mighty rivers through
the country of Thought, bearing fleets of traffickers and assiduous
pearl-fishers on their waves, this little Valclusa Fountain will also
arrest our eye; for this also is of Nature's own and most cunning
workmanship, bursts from the depths of the earth, with a full gushing
current, into the light of day; and often will the traveller turn aside
to drink of its clear waters, and muse among its rocks and
pines."&mdash;<i>Carlyle.</i></p>

<p>"Burns is not the poet's poet, which Shelley no doubt meant to be, or
the philosopher's poet, which Wordsworth, in spite of himself, is. He is
the poet of homely human nature, not half so homely or prosaic as it
seems. His genius, in a manner all its own, associates itself with the
fortunes, experiences, memorable moments, of human <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[<a href="./images/112.png">112</a>]</span>beings whose
humanity is their sole patrimony; to whom 'liberty and whatever, like
liberty, has the power</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To raise a man above the brute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mak him ken himsel,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is their portion in life; for whom the great epochs and
never-to-be-forgotten phases of existence are those which are occasioned
by emotions inseparable from the consciousness of existence. For the
great majority of his readers, and therefore for the mass of human
beings, the sympathy which exists between him and them is sympathy
relative to their strongest and deepest feelings, and this is sympathy
out of which personal affection naturally springs, and in the strength
of which it cannot but grow strong."&mdash;<i>John Service.</i></p>

<p>"Burns was not like Shakespeare in the range of his genius, but there is
something of the same magnanimity, directness, and unaffected character
about him. With but little of Shakespeare's imagination or inventive
power, he had the same life of mind; within the narrow circle of
personal feeling or domestic incidents, the pulse of his poetry flows as
healthily and vigorously. He had an eye to see, a heart to feel,&mdash;no
more. His pictures of good fellowship, of social life, of quaint humor,
are equal to anything; they come up to nature, and they cannot go beyond
it."&mdash;<i>Hazlitt.</i></p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>Boadicea was queen of the Iceni, a powerful and warlike tribe of
Britons, about the middle of the first century. Upon the death of her
husband, Prasutagus, her kingdom was seized by the Romans, and she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[<a href="./images/115.png">115</a>]</span>herself, for some real or imaginary offence, was publicly scourged.
During the absence of the Roman governor from that part of England,
Boadicea raised an immense army, burned the city of London, and put
70,000 Romans to the sword. She afterwards, with 230,000 troops, met the
Roman army, under Suetonius, in the field, and although the Romans could
muster only 10,000 soldiers, the British army was defeated, and the
queen, in despair, ended her own life by taking poison.</p>

<p>In this poem, Cowper represents the queen as, soon after her shameful
treatment by the Romans, seeking counsel from one of the native priests.
The Druid prophesies the destruction of Rome and the future greatness of
Britain.</p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>This, one of the most exquisite poems in the language, was written by
Cowper in "the last glimmering of the evening light," before his mind
was wholly overwhelmed by the final attack of insanity. "Every line is
instinct with a profound and chastened feeling, to which it would be
difficult to find a parallel. There is not a phrase, not a word, which
jars upon the most susceptible ear, not a tinge of exaggeration, not a
touch that is excessive. The fact that he who gave forth these supreme
utterances of filial love was old himself when he did it, brings into
the relationship a strange, tender equality which is marvellously
touching."</p>

<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">William Cowper</span> was born at Great Berkhamstead, November 26, 1731. His
father was the rector of the parish, and his mother was Ann Donne of the
family of the famous John Donne. Cowper was educated at a private school
and afterwards at Westminster. It was intended that he should follow the
profession of law, and, after the completion of his studies at
Westminster, he entered the Middle Temple and was articled to a
solicitor. At the age of twenty-two, through the influence of his uncle,
Major Cowper, he was appointed to two clerkships in the House of Lords.
The excitement brought on by this occurrence, together with an unhappy
love affair, induced an attack of insanity, from which he suffered for
more than a year. In 1773 he suffered from a second attack of insanity,
which continued for sixteen months. It was not until 1780, when in his
fiftieth year, that he began really to write poetry. His first volume
was published in 1782, and comprised, besides several shorter pieces,
the three poems, "Conversation," "Retirement," and "Table Talk." His
second volume appeared in 1785, and contained "The Task," "Tirocinium,"
and the ballad of "John Gilpin," which had already become famous through
the recitations of one Henderson, an actor. Cowper's translation of
Homer was completed and published in 1791. From that time until his
death in 1800 he suffered from hopeless dejection, regarding himself as
an object of divine wrath, a condemned and forsaken outcast.</p>

<p>Cowper was not a great poet; but he was the first to abandon the
mechanical versification and conventional phrases of the artificial
poets, to find inspiration and guidance in nature. It may be said that
he lacked creative power; but he possessed a quickness of thought, a
depth of feeling, and a certain manliness and sincerity, which lifted
him above the level of the ordinary versifiers of his time.</p>

<span class="i0">Up yonder hill the village murmur rose.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The mingling notes came soften'd from below:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The swain responsive as the milkmaid sung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sober herd that low'd to meet their young,<br /></span>

whole character seems traced as it were in an expiatory spirit; as if,
conscious of his own wandering restlessness, he sought to humble himself

was placed when six years old. "Byrne had been educated for a
pedagogue," says Irving, "but had enlisted in the army, served abroad
during the wars of Queen Anne's time, and risen to the rank of
quartermaster of a regiment in Spain. At the return of peace, having no
longer exercise for the sword, he resumed the ferule, and drilled the
urchin populace of Lissoy.</p>

<p>"There are certain whimsical traits in the character of Byrne, not given
in the foregoing sketch. He was fond of talking of his vagabond
wanderings in foreign lands, and had brought with him from the wars a
world of campaigning stories of which he was generally the hero, and
which he would deal forth to his wondering scholars when he ought to
have been teaching them their lessons. These travellers' tales had a
powerful effect upon the vivid imagination of Goldsmith, and awakened an
unconquerable passion for wandering and seeking adventure.</p>

<p>"Byrne was, moreover, of a romantic vein, and exceedingly superstitious.

<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver Goldsmith</span> was born at Pallas, county of Longford, Ireland, on the
10th of November, 1728. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and
afterwards studied medicine at Edinburgh and at Leyden. After travelling
on foot through portions of Western Europe, he made his way to London,
where he was in turn assistant to a chemist, usher in a school at
Peckham, and literary hack for one of the leading monthly publications.
He afterwards contributed many articles, both in prose and poetry, to
the leading periodicals of the time. He wrote "The Traveller" in 1764,
and "The Deserted Village" and <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i> in 1770. He died
in his chambers in Brick Court, London, April 4, 1774. For a full
account of his life, read Macaulay's Essay on Oliver Goldsmith.</p>

<p>"The naturalness and ease of Goldsmith's poetry," says Edward Dowden,
"are those of an accomplished craftsman. His verse, which flows towards
the close of the period with such a gentle yet steady advance, is not
less elaborated than that of Pope; and Goldsmith conceived his verse
more in paragraphs than in couplets. His artless words were, each one,
delicately chosen; his simple constructions were studiously sought." And
Sir Walter Scott said of him: "It would be difficult to point out one
among the English poets less likely to be excelled in his own style.
Possessing much of Pope's versification without the monotonous structure
of his lines; rising sometimes to the swell and fulness of Dryden,
without his inflections; delicate and masterly in his descriptions;
graceful in one of the greatest graces of poetry, its transitions; alike
successful in his sportive or grave, his playful or melancholy mood; he
may long bid defiance to the numerous competitors whom the friendship or
flattery of the present age is so hastily arraying against him."</p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>This poem was published in 1757. "It is founded," says Gray, "on a
tradition current in Wales that Edward I., when he completed the
conquest of that country, ordered all the bards that fell into his hands
to be put to death." The argument is as follows: "The army of Edward I.,
as they march through a deep valley, and approach Mount Snowdon, are
suddenly stopped by the appearance of a venerable figure seated on the
summit of an inaccessible rock, who, with a voice more than human,
reproaches the king with all the desolation and misery which he had
brought on his country; foretells the misfortunes of the Norman race,
and with prophetic spirit declares that all his cruelty shall never
extinguish the noble ardor of poetic genius in this island; and that men
shall never be wanting to celebrate true virtue and valor in immortal
strains, to expose vice and infamous pleasure, and boldly censure
tyranny and oppression. His song ended, he precipitates himself from the
mountain, and is swallowed up by the river that rolls at its feet."</p>

<p>The tradition upon which the poem is said to be founded, if it ever had
any existence, is in great part mythical. Edward I. did indeed conquer
Wales, but there is no evidence that he massacred or even persecuted the
Welsh bards. A hundred years after his time their number and influence
had not been diminished.</p>

<p>This poem is a good example of an English ode constructed strictly after
Greek models. It will be observed that it is written, not in uniform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[<a href="./images/135.png">135</a>]</span>stanzas, but in three uniform parts, each of which contains three
stanzas. The first of these parts is called the <i>Strophe</i>, or Turn; the
second, the <i>Antistrophe</i>, or Counter-turn; the third, the <i>Epode</i>, or
After-song. The origin of these terms may be traced to the use of the
ode as an important part of the entertainment presented in the ancient
Greek theatre. The Strophe was sung while the chorus moved from one side
of the orchestra to the other; the Antistrophe while the reversed
movement was being made; and the Epodos after the singers had returned
to their original position. The accurate perception of harmony and the
relationship between the different parts of the choral ode, which
enabled the Greeks to enter thoroughly into its enjoyment, is unknown
among moderns. Hence, there have been but few attempts in the English
language to construct odes strictly after the Greek model. Most of our
odes are poems relating to themes of greater or less varying length, and
divided into many irregular stanzas of varying lengths and metres. Such
are Dryden's "Alexander's Feast," Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale," and
Wordsworth's "Ode on the Intimations of Immortality," all of which are
odes in form and style, although differing from their Greek prototype
and from one another. Of all English poets, none have worked so
thoroughly on the ancient model as Gray, although to Congreve must be
given the honor of being the first to attempt this species of English
composition.</p>

<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Gray</span> was born in Cornhill, London, December 26th, 1716. Through
the help of his mother's brother, who was Assistant-Master at that
famous school, he received his primary education at Eton, and in 1735
entered St. Peter's College, Cambridge. In 1738 he left the University
without taking a degree, intending to study law at the Inner Temple.
Soon afterwards, however, he accompanied Horace Walpole on a tour
through France and Italy, and spent the greater part of two years in
Paris, Rome, and Florence. Upon his return to England, finding himself
possessed of a life-long competency, he resolved to give up the law and
devote himself entirely to self-culture. He settled at Cambridge, and
gave all his time to study and to the cultivation of his mind. The first
of his poems to appear in print was the "Ode on a Distant Prospect of
Eton College," published in 1747. His "Elegy Written in a Country
Churchyard" was not published until 1750, although it had been written
and handed about in manuscript several years before. The post of
Poet-Laureate was offered him in 1757, on the death of Colley Cibber;
but he did not accept it. In 1768 he was appointed Professor of Modern
History at Cambridge, but the state of his health was such that he was
never permitted to lecture. He died, July 29th, 1771, at the age of
fifty-four.</p>

<p>"He was certainly the most accomplished man of his time," says Hales,
"and was something much more than accomplished. His learning was not
only wide but deep; his taste, if perhaps too <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[<a href="./images/140.png">140</a>]</span>fastidious, was pure and
thorough; his genius was of no mean degree or order; his affections were
of the truest and sincerest.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His poems are works of refinement rather
than of passion; but yet they are inspired with genuine sentiment. They
are no doubt extremely artificial in form; the weight of their author's
reading somewhat depresses their originality; he can with difficulty
escape from his books to himself; but yet there is in him a genuine
poetical spirit. His poetry, however elaborated, is sincere and
truthful. If the exterior is what Horace might have called over-filed
and polished, the thought is mostly of the simplest and naturalest."</p>

<p>Matthew Arnold says: "Gray's production was scanty, and scanty it could
not but be. Even what he produced was not always pure in diction, true
in evolution. Still, with whatever drawbacks, he is alone or almost
alone in his age. Gray said himself that the style he aimed at was
'extreme conciseness of expression, yet pure, perspicuous, and musical.'
Compared, not with the work of the great masters of the golden ages of
poetry, but with the poetry of his own contemporaries in general, Gray
may be said to have reached, in his style, the excellence at which he
aimed."</p>

<p>Cowper writes, "I have been reading Gray's works, and think him the only
poet since Shakespeare entitled to the character of sublime."</p>

<p>Lowell says: "Gray, if we may believe the commentators, has not an idea,
scarcely an epithet, that he can call his own, and yet he is, in the
best sense, one of the classics of English literature."</p>

<p>And Sir James Mackintosh says: "Of all English poets he was the most
finished artist. He attained the highest degree of splendor of which
poetic style seemed to be capable. It may be added that he deserves the
comparatively trifling praise of having been the most learned poet since
Milton."</p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>Pope's "Essay on Criticism" was published in 1711. It consists of 724
lines, and is written in heroic couplets&mdash;that style of poetic
composition in which Pope excelled all others. It is full of sound
critical precepts, put together with considerable art, and expressed in
a manner which, at the time of its production, insured the popularity of
the poem and the fame of its author. It was probably suggested by
Boileau's "Art Po&eacute;tique," which was founded on Horace's "Ars Poetica,"
and it in turn on Aristotle's rules, very commonly known among the
classical poets. "The Essay," says De Quincey, "is a collection of
independent maxims tied together into a fasciculus by the printer, but
having no natural order or logical dependence; generally so vague as to
mean nothing. And, what is remarkable, many of the rules are violated by
no man so often as by Pope, and by Pope nowhere so often as in this
poem."</p>

maxims which Pope has strung together in this poem, but he has dressed
them so neatly, and turned them out with such sparkle and point, that
these truisms have acquired a weight not their own, and they circulate
as proverbs among us in virtue of their pithy form rather than their
truth. They exemplify his own line, 'What oft was thought, but ne'er so
well expressed.' Pope told Spence that he had gone through all the best
critics, specifying Quintilian, Rapin, and Le Bossu. But whatever
trouble he took in collecting what to say, his main effort is expended
upon how to say it."&mdash;<i>Pattison.</i></p>

tumbles to the bottom. This double motion of the stone is admirably

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>This poem was written in 1708 at the suggestion of Sir Richard Steele;
it was set to music by Maurice Greene, and in 1730 was performed at the
public commemoration at Cambridge. Its model is Dryden's famous ode,
"Alexander's Feast," of which Pope was a warm admirer (see page <a href="#Page_159">159</a>).
Dr. Johnson says; "In his 'Ode on St. Cecilia's Day' Pope is generally
confessed to have miscarried; yet he has miscarried only as compared
with Dryden, for he has far outgone other competitors. Dryden's plan is
better chosen; history will always take stronger hold of the passions
than fable: the passions excited by Dryden are the pleasures and pains
of real life; the scene of Pope is laid in imaginary existence; Pope is
read with calm acquiescence, Dryden with turbulent delight; Pope hangs
upon the ear, Dryden finds the passes of the mind. Both the odes want
the essential constituent of metrical compositions, the stated
recurrence of settled numbers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If Pope's ode be particularly
inspected, it will be found that the first stanza consists of sounds,
well chosen, indeed, but only sounds. The second consists of
hyperbolical commonplaces, easily to be found, and, perhaps, without
much difficulty to be as well expressed. In the third, however, there
are numbers, images, harmony, and vigor not unworthy the antagonist of
Dryden. Had all been like this&mdash;but every part cannot be the best. The
next stanzas place and detain us in the dark and dismal regions of
mythology; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we have all that can be performed by elegance of diction
or sweetness of versification; but what can form avail without better
matter? The last stanza again refers to commonplaces. The conclusion is
too evidently modelled by that of Dryden; and it may be remarked that
both end with the same fault&mdash;the comparison of each is literal on one
side and metaphorical on the other. Poets do not always express their
own thoughts. Pope, with all this labor in the praise of music, was
ignorant of its principles and insensible of its effects."</p>

<p>St. Cecilia, the Christian Polyhymnia and patron saint of sacred music,
is said to have suffered martyrdom about the year 230. In Chaucer's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>[<a href="./images/153.png">153</a>]</span>"Seconde Nonnes Tale"&mdash;which is an almost literal translation of the
"Legenda Aurea," written in the thirteenth century&mdash;it is related that,
on account of Cecilia's spotless purity, an angel came down from heaven
to be her guardian. Her husband, Valerian, was also the recipient of
angelic favors, for</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This angel had of roses and lilie<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Corones two, the which he bare in honde,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And first to Cecile, as I understonde,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">He yaf that on, and after gan he take<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">That other to Valerian hire make."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How and when Cecilia was first recognized as the patron saint of music
does not appear. The legend only says, that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"While the organs maden melodie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To God alone thus in hire hert song she;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'O Lord, my soule and eke my body gie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwemmed, lest that I confounded be.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is also a tradition in the church that St. Cecilia was the
inventor of the organ. Dryden calls her "inventress of the vocal frame"
(see page <a href="#Page_164">164</a>). The origin of this musical instrument is not known, but
the first organs used in Italy are said to have been brought thither
from Greece. Some of the Roman churches are known to have had them in
use in the seventh century, but they were not common until several
hundred years later. The festival of St. Cecilia occurs on the 22d of
November.</p>

<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexander Pope</span> was born in London in 1688. He had some instruction at
home, and was afterwards sent, first to a Roman Catholic seminary near
Winchester, then to another in London. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>[<a href="./images/156.png">156</a>]</span>"This," he said, "was all the
teaching I ever had, and God knows it extended a very little way. When I
had done with my priests, I took to reading by myself, for which I had a
very great eagerness and enthusiasm, especially for poetry: and in a few
years I had dipped into a very great number of the English, Italian,
Latin, and Greek poets." He was small of stature and deformed, and his
ill health made him peevish, irritable, and selfish. Yet his rare
intellectual abilities and the deserved success of his earlier poetry
secured for him the friendship of many of the most influential men of
the time. Bolingbroke declared that he never knew a man more tenderly
devoted to his friends; and Warburton said, "He is as good a companion
as poet, and, what is more, appears to be a good man."</p>

<p>Pope's "Essay on Criticism" was published in 1711; the "Rape of the
Lock" in 1714; his translation of Homer's "Iliad" in 1715-18, and of the
"Odyssey" in 1726; the "Dunciad" in 1728; the "Essay on Man" in 1732. A
revised and enlarged version of the "Dunciad" was published in 1742. The
latter part of Pope's life was spent at his country-seat of Twickenham,
which he enlarged and beautified from the proceeds of his translation of
Homer. He died in 1744.</p>

<p>"Pope is our greatest master in didactic poetry," says Stopford Brooke,
"not so much because of the worth of the thoughts as because of the
masterly form in which they are put."</p>

<p>"In two directions," says Mark Pattison, "in that of condensing and
pointing his meaning, and in that of drawing the utmost harmony of sound
out of the couplet, Pope carried versification far beyond the point at
which it was when he took it up. The matter which he worked up into his
verse has a permanent value, and is indeed one of the most precious
heirlooms which the eighteenth century has bequeathed us."</p>

<h2>The Seventeenth Century.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<i>The people of the seventeenth century were weary of liberty, weary of
the unmitigated rage of the dramatists, cloyed with the roses and the
spices and the kisses of the lyrists, tired of being carried over the
universe and up and down the avenues of history at the freak of every
irresponsible rhymester. Literature had been set open to all the breezes
of heaven by the blustering and glittering Elizabethans, and in the
hands of their less gifted successors it was fast declining into a mere
Cave of the Winds.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We know the poets of the early Caroline period
almost entirely by extracts, and their ardor, quaintness, and sudden
flashes of inspiration give them a singular advantage in this form. The
sustained elevation which had characterized Shakespeare and Spenser, and
even in some degree several of the chief of their contemporaries, had
passed away, but still the poets were most brilliant, most delectable in
their purple patches.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As the last waves of the Renaissance died away,
a deathly calm settled down upon the pools of thought. Man returned from
the particular to the general, from romantic examples to those
disquisitions on the norm which were thought to display a classical
taste. The seer disappeared, and the artificer took his place. For a
whole century the singer that only sang because he must, and as the
linnets do, was entirely absent from English literature. He came back at
the close of the eighteenth century, with Burns in Scotland, and with
Blake in England.</i>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Edmund Gosse.</span></p>

<p>"<i>At the same time, amid the classical coldness which then dried up
English literature, and the social excess which then corrupted English
morals .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. appeared a mighty and superb mind (Milton), prepared by logic
and enthusiasm for eloquence and the epic style; the heir of a poetical
age, the precursor of an austere age, holding his place between the
epoch of unselfish dreaming and the epoch of practical action.</i>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Taine.</span></p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>This song was written in 1697. Lord Bolingbroke relates that, calling
upon the poet one morning, Dryden said to him: "I have been up all
night; my musical friends made me promise to write them an ode for their
Feast of St. Cecilia, and I was so struck with the subject which
occurred to me that I could not leave it till I had completed it: here
it is, finished at one sitting."</p>

<p>The poem was first set to music by one Jeremiah Clarke, a steward of the
Musical Society, whose members had solicited Dryden to write it. In 1736
it was rearranged by the great composer Handel, and again presented at a
public performance.</p>

<p>M. Taine says, "His 'Alexander's Feast' is an admirable trumpet-blast,
in which metre and sound impress upon the nerves the emotions of the
mind, a master-piece of rapture and of art, which Victor Hugo alone has
come up to."</p>

<p>"As a piece of poetical mechanism to be set to music, or recited in
alternate strophe and anti-strophe," says Hazlitt, "nothing can be
better."</p>

<p>"This ode is Dryden's greatest and best work."&mdash;<i>Macaulay.</i></p>

prince still more by striking into what were called Harmatian measures.
Quintus Curtius gives a minute description of the burning of the palace
at Persepolis, when Alexander was accompanied by Thais. But it does not
appear in the accurate Arrian that Thais had any share in this

under the immediate protection of an angel. But it was not her sweet
playing, but her spotless purity, that brought the angel to earth, not
to listen, but to be "a heavenly guard."</p>

<p>Compare these last four lines with those at the close of Pope's Ode.</p>

<p>Dr. Warton says of "Alexander's Feast": "If Dryden had never written
anything but this ode, his name would have been immortal, as would that
of Gray, if he had never written anything but his 'Bard.' It is
difficult to find new terms to express our admiration of the variety,
richness, and melody of its numbers; the force, beauty, and distinctness
of its images; the succession of so many different passions and
feelings; and the matchless perspicuity of its diction. No particle of
it can be wished away, but the epigrammatic turn of the four concluding
lines."</p>

<p>Hallam says: "This ode has a few lines mingled with a far greater number
ill conceived and ill expressed; the whole composition has that spirit
which Dryden hardly ever wanted, but it is too faulty for high praise.
It used to pass for the best work of Dryden and the best ode in the
language. But few lines are highly poetical, and some sink to the level
of a common drinking song. It has the defects as well as the merits of
that poetry which is written for musical accompaniment."</p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>This selection from Dryden's long and very tedious poem, "Annus
Mirabilis, the year of Wonders, 1666," is given here as a specimen of
that kind of mechanical versification so popular in the latter half of
the seventeenth century. "That part of my poem which describes the
Fire," says Dryden, "I owe first to the piety and fatherly affection of
our monarch to his suffering subjects; and, in the second place, to the
courage, loyalty, and magnanimity of the city; both of which were so
conspicuous that I have wanted words to celebrate them as they deserve.
And I have chosen to write my poem in quatrains or stanzas of four in
alternate rhyme, because I have ever judged them more noble, and of
greater dignity, both for the sound and number, than any other verse in
use amongst us." This opinion, however, was certainly not long
maintained by the poet, for he never afterward practised that form of
versification which he has here praised.</p>

<i>Pudding-lane</i> near <i>New Fish-street</i>; which, falling out in a part of
the city so close built with wooden houses .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in a short time became
too big to be mastered by any engines or working near it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It
continued all Monday and Tuesday with such impetuosity, that it consumed
houses and churches all the way to <i>St. Dunstan's Church</i>, in
<i>Fleet-street</i>; at which time, by the favour of God, the wind slackened;
and that night, by the vigilancy, industry, and indefatigable pains of
his Majesty and his Royal Highness, calling upon all people, and
encouraging them by their personal assistances, a stop was put to the
fire in Fleet-street, etc. But on Wednesday night it suddenly broke out
afresh in the <i>Inner Temple</i>. His Royal Highness in person fortunately
watching there that night, by his care, diligence, great labour, and
seasonable commands for the blowing up, with gunpowder, some of the said
buildings, it was most happily before day extinguished."</p>

<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">John Dryden</span> was born on the 9th of August, 1631, at Aldwincle All
Saints, near Oundle in Northamptonshire. He was educated at Westminster
School, under the famous Dr. Busby, and at Trinity College, Cambridge.
At the age of twenty-six he went up to London with the intention of
devoting himself to literature and politics. During the brief remaining
years of the Commonwealth (1657-1660) he was nominally a friend to the
Puritan party; and one of the first poems written by him was a series of
"Heroic Stanzas on the Death of Oliver Cromwell." At the Restoration he
at once espoused the cause of the Royalists; and his recent panegyric on
the Protector did not prevent him from writing a poem, "Astr&aelig;a Redux,"
in honor of the return of Charles the Second. In 1663 he married the
Lady Elizabeth Howard, a daughter of the Earl of Berkshire, a Royalist
nobleman. For several years he devoted himself chiefly to the writing of
plays,&mdash;comedies, tragedies, and tragi-comedies. The comedies he wrote
in prose; the earliest tragedies in blank verse, followed by several in
rhyme, and, after these, others in blank verse. In 1670 he was appointed
Poet-Laureate. In 1681, when nearly fifty years old, by the publication
of "Absalom and Achitophel," he suddenly became famous as a satirical
poet. He soon afterwards wrote "The Medal," another satire, directed
against the Earl of Shaftesbury, and "Mac Flecknoe," aimed at Shadwell,
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>[<a href="./images/176.png">176</a>]</span>chief poet of the Opposition. At about the same time he produced
"Religio Laici," a didactic poem explaining his religious opinions and
defending the Church of England against dissenters, atheists, and
Catholics. Not long after the accession of James II., Dryden, true to
his policy of being always on the side of the ruling party, became a
Catholic, and wrote "The Hind and the Panther," in which he eulogized
many things that, in the former poem, he had ridiculed. His political
career ended with the overthrow of James II., in 1688; but his literary
activity continued unabated. The last years of his life were occupied in
translating the works of Persius and Juvenal and the &AElig;neid of Virgil. In
1697 he wrote "Alexander's Feast"; and his "modernizations" of some of
Chaucer's poems appeared in 1700, the year of his death.</p>

<p>"If there is grandeur in the pomp of kings and the march of hosts," says
A. W. Ward, "in the 'trumpet's loud clangor' and in tapestries and
carpetings of velvet and gold, Dryden is to be ranked with the grandest
of English poets. The irresistible impetus of an invective which never
falls short or flat, and the savor of a satire which never seems dull or
stale, give him an undisputed place among the most glorious of English
wits."</p>

<p>"His descriptive power was of the highest," says Hales. "Our literature
has in it no more vigorous portrait-gallery than that he has bequeathed
it. His power of expression is beyond praise. There is always a singular
<i>fitness</i> in his language: he uses always the right word. He is one of
our greatest masters of metre: metre was, in fact, no restraint to him,
but rather it seems to have given him freedom. It has been observed that
he argues better in verse than in prose; verse was the natural costume
of his thoughts."</p>

<p>Professor Masson says: "Not only is Dryden the largest figure in one era
of our literature: he is a very considerable figure also in our
literature as a whole. Of all that he wrote, however, there is but a
comparatively small portion that has won for itself a permanent place in
our literature."</p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>This poem was begun by Milton on Christmas day, 1629. He had then just
completed his twenty-first year, and was still an undergraduate at
Christ's College, Cambridge. From certain fragments and other evidence,
it is believed that he contemplated writing a series of poems on great
Christian events in a similar way. This is the first poem of importance
which he wrote. Hallam speaks of it as perhaps the finest lyric of its
kind in the English language. "A grandeur, a simplicity, a breadth of
manner, an imagination at once elevated and restrained by the subject,
reign throughout it. If Pindar is a model of lyric poetry, it would be
hard to name any other ode so truly Pindaric; but more has naturally
been derived from the Scriptures."</p>

earth was the centre of the universe, and that all the heavenly bodies
revolved about it, being fixed in a complicated framework, or series of

It was the duty of the king's harbinger, when the court removed from one
place to another, to provide lodgings for the king's retinue. Derived
from <i>harbor</i>, <i>harborage</i>. The word "harbor" is from A.-S. <i>here</i>,
army, and <i>beorg</i>, a refuge. Others derive the word from <i>har</i>, a
message, and <i>bringer</i>&mdash;hence, one who brings a message, a herald.</p>

<p>Parkes's <i>Topography of Hampstead</i>, 1818, contains the following:</p>

<p>"The office of harbinger still exists in the Royal Household, the
nominal duty of the officer being to ride one stage onward before the
king on his progress, to provide lodging and provision for the court."</p>

<p>The last knight-harbinger was Sir Henry Rycroft (appointed in 1816, died
October, 1846, aged eighty). The office became extinct at his death.</p>

orbs in their motion could not but produce a certain sound or note,
depending upon their distances and velocities; and as these were
regulated by harmonic laws, they necessarily formed as a whole a
complete musical scale." "In the whorl of the distaff of necessity there
are eight concentric whorls. These whorls represent respectively the sun
and moon, the five planets, and the fixed stars. On each whorl sits a
siren singing. Their eight tones make one exquisite harmony." Milton
added a ninth whorl,&mdash;"that swift nocturnal and diurnal rhomb,"&mdash;and
then spoke of the "ninefold harmony," as just below. This was a favorite

<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">John Milton</span> was born in Bread Street, Cheapside, London, in the year
1608, eight years before the death of Shakespeare. From his boyhood he
showed the possession of more than ordinary powers of mind. He was
educated first under private tutors, and at St. Paul's School, and
finally at Christ's College, Cambridge, where in 1632 he received the
degree of "Master of Arts." His first considerable work was the "Hymn on
the Morning of the Nativity," written in 1629. Within the next seven
years he wrote the most noteworthy of his shorter poems: the masque,
"Comus"; the pastoral piece entitled "Arcades"; the beautiful
descriptive poems, "L'Allegro" and "II Penseroso"; and the elegy,
"Lycidas." In 1639 he made a tour upon the Continent, visited the famous
seats of learning in France and Italy, and made the acquaintance of many
of the great poets and scholars of his time. Upon hearing, however, that
civil war was about to break out in England, he hastened home, resolved
to devote himself to what he regarded as his country's best interests.
Poetry was abandoned for politics, and for the next twenty years he
wrote little except prose&mdash;political tracts and controversial essays.
When Cromwell became Lord Protector of England, Milton was appointed
Latin Secretary of State, a position <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>[<a href="./images/196.png">196</a>]</span>which he continued to hold until
towards the downfall of the Commonwealth. But after the Restoration he
quietly withdrew into retirement, resolved to devote the remainder of
his life to the writing of the great poem which he had been
contemplating for many years. Through unceasing study he had lost his
sight; the friends of his youth had deserted him; the fortune which he
had received from his father was gone. And so it was in darkness, and
disappointment, and poverty, that in 1667 he gave to the world the great
English epic, "Paradise Lost." It was in that same year that Dryden
published his "Annus Mirabilis." Milton shortly afterward wrote
"Paradise Regained"; and, in 1671, he produced "Samson Agonistes," a
tragedy modelled after the masterpieces of the Greek drama. On the 8th
of November, 1674, at the age of sixty-six years, his strangely eventful
life came to a close.</p>

<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert Herrick</span> was born in Cheapside, London, August 20, 1591. He was
educated at Cambridge, and in 1629, having taken orders, was presented
to the vicarage of Dean Prior in Devonshire. From this living he was
ejected by the Long Parliament in 1648, and, going up to London, he
united himself with some of his former associates and entered upon a
career not altogether creditable to his profession of parson. At the
restoration of Charles II. he was returned to his vicarage, where he
remained until his death in 1674. His best poems are included in the
collection entitled "Hesperides, or Works Humane and Divine," published
in 1648, and dedicated to "the most illustrious and most hopeful Prince
Charles." The "Argument" prefixed to this collection very prettily
describes the character of the pieces which it contains:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I sing of brooks, of blossoms, birds, and bowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Of April, May, of June, and July-flowers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">I sing of May-poles, hock-carts, wassails, wakes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Of bride-grooms, brides, and of their bridal-cakes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">I write of Youth, of Love;&mdash;and have access<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">By these, to sing of cleanly wantonness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">I sing of dews, of rains, and, piece by piece,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Of balm, of oil, of spice, of ambergris.<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">I sing of times trans-shifting; and I write<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">How roses first came red, and lilies white.<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">I write of groves, of twilights, and I sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The court of Mab, and of the Fairy King;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">I write of Hell; I sing, and ever shall<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Of Heaven,&mdash;and hope to have it after all."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Herrick's best things," says Robert Buchanan, "are his poems in praise
of the country life, and his worst things are his epigrams. His
gladsome, mercurial temper had a great deal to do with the composition
of his best lyrics; for the parson of Dean Prior was no philosopher, and
his lightest, airiest verses are the best. His was a happy, careless
nature, throwing off verses out of the fulness of a joyous heart,
rioting in a pleasant, sunny element."</p>

<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Edmund Waller</span>, whose poetry is noticeable because he was the first
English versifier to adopt the French fashion of writing in couplets,
was born in Warwickshire in 1605. He was elected to Parliament at the
age of seventeen, and was a member of that body <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>[<a href="./images/206.png">206</a>]</span>during the greater part
of his life. At the beginning of the difficulties between the king and
the Parliament, he gained some notoriety by his opposition to the
former, but when the Civil War broke out he attached himself to the
Royalist cause. In 1643, being convicted of complicity in a plot against
Parliament, he was fined &pound;10,000 and imprisoned for twelve months. After
his release he went to France; but in 1653 he returned to England and
became reconciled to the new government, writing, soon afterward, "A
Panegyric to my Lord Protector, of the present Greatness and joint
Interest of his Highness and this Nation." At the Restoration he eagerly
declared allegiance to Charles II., and wrote a congratulatory ode on
that monarch's return. He became a court favorite, noted for his wit,
was made provost of Eton, and returned to his old place in Parliament.
He died October 21, 1687. The first edition of his poems was published
in 1645, and from that time to the close of the seventeenth century he
was quite generally regarded as the greatest of English poets. At the
present time there are few writers so little considered as he.</p>

<p>Waller may be regarded as the founder of the classical school of English
poetry, in which Dryden and Pope excelled, and which remained in the
ascendency for more than a century after his death. "The excellence and
dignity of rhyme," says Dryden, "were never fully known till Mr. Waller
taught it; he first made writing easily an art, first showed us to
conclude the sense, most commonly, in distichs, which in the verse of
those before him runs on for so many lines together, that the reader is
out of breath to overtake it."</p>

<p>And Dr. Johnson says: "He certainly very much excelled in smoothness
most of the writers who were living when his poetry commenced. But he
was rather smooth than strong: of the 'full resounding line' which Pope
attributes to Dryden, he has given very few examples. The general
character of his poetry is elegance and gaiety. He seems neither to have
had a mind much elevated by nature, nor amplified by learning. His
thoughts are such as a liberal conversation and large acquaintance with
life would easily supply."</p>

<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Ben Jonson</span> was born in Westminster, in 1573. His early life was full of
hard and varied experiences. He was educated at Westminster School, and
entered St. John's College, Cambridge. Being obliged to leave his
university course unfinished, he worked for a time with his step-father
as a brick-layer. At the age of eighteen he enlisted as a volunteer in
the Low Countries; but in 1596 he settled in London, as a playwright.
His first comedy, "Every Man in his Humour," did not meet with immediate
success. It was remodelled, at Shakespeare's suggestion, and when
afterwards presented was received with marked favor. His first tragedy,
"Sejanus," was acted in 1603. His masques, of which there are
thirty-six, were written during the reign of James I. His miscellaneous
works, embracing a variety of odes, elegies, epigrams, and other lyrics
and epistles, are included in two collections, the first of which,
called <i>The Forest</i>, was published in 1616, and the second posthumously,
in 1641. He died in London, August 6, 1637.</p>

<p>One of the last and most beautiful of Jonson's dramas is the unfinished
pastoral comedy, "The Sad Shepherd." It was written while in the
sick-chamber, with a keen sense and remembrance of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>[<a href="./images/214.png">214</a>]</span>the disappointments
which had followed him through life; and to these he touchingly refers
in the prologue:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He that hath feasted you these forty years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And fitted fables for your finer ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Although at first he scarce could hit the bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Yet you, with patience, hearkening more and more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">At length have grown up to him, and made known<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The working of his pen is now your own:<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">He prays you would vouchsafe, for your own sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">To hear him this once more, but sit awake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And though he now present you with such wool<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">As from mere English flocks his muse can pull,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">He hopes when it is made up into cloth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Not the most curious head here will be loth<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">To wear a hood of it, it being a fleece,<br /></span>

<h2>The Sixteenth Century.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<i>In fifty-two years, without counting the drama, two hundred and
thirty-three poets are enumerated, of whom forty have genius or
talent.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What is this condition which gives rise to so universal a
taste for poetry? What is it breathes life into their books? How happens
it, that amongst the least, in spite of pedantrie, awkwardnesses, we
meet with brilliant pictures and genuine love-cries? How happens it,
that when this generation was exhausted, true poetry ended in England,
as true painting in Italy and Flanders? It was because an epoch of the
mind came and passed away,&mdash;that, namely, of instinctive and creative
conception. These men had new senses, and no theories in their heads.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
They are happy in contemplating beautiful things, and wish only that
they should be the most beautiful possible. They do not excite
themselves to express moral or philosophical ideas. They wish to enjoy
through the imagination, through the eyes, like those Italian nobles,
who, at the same time, were so captivated by fine colors and forms, that
they covered with paintings not only their rooms and their churches, but
the lids of their chests and the saddles of their horses.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Think what
poetry was likely to spring from them, how superior to common events,
how free from literal imitation, how smitten with ideal beauty, how
capable of creating a world beyond our sad world.</i>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Taine.</span></p>

<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">William Shakespeare</span> was born at Stratford-on-Avon in April, 1564, and
died there April 23, 1616. His fame rests chiefly upon his dramatic
compositions. His two narrative poems, "Venus <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>[<a href="./images/222.png">222</a>]</span>and Adonis" and "The Rape
of Lucrece," were published in 1593 and 1594, before any of his plays
had been printed. They may be regarded as companion pieces, written in
the same style and distinguished by similar characteristics.</p>

<p>"A couple of ice-houses," says Dowden, "these two poems of Shakespeare
have been called by Hazlitt; 'they are,' he says, 'as hard, as
glittering, as cold.' Cold indeed they will seem to any one who listens
to hear in them the natural cry of human passion. But the paradox is
true, that for a young poet of Elizabeth's age to be natural, direct,
simple, would have been indeed unnatural. He was most happy when most
fantastical; he spun a shining web to catch conceits inevitably as a
spider casts his thread; the quick-building wit was itself warm while
erecting its ice-houses." Coleridge says of the "Venus and Adonis" that
its most obvious excellence "is the perfect sweetness of the
versification; its adaptation to the subject; and the power displayed in
varying the march of the words without passing into a loftier and more
majestic rhythm than was demanded by the thoughts, or permitted by the
propriety of preserving a sense of melody predominant."</p>

<p>Shakespeare's "Sonnets" were published in 1609. Concerning the origin,
purpose, and interpretation of these poems, many widely different
theories have been proposed, "Some have looked on them as one poem."
says Fleay; "some as several poems&mdash;of groups of sonnets; some as
containing a separate poem in each sonnet. They have been supposed to be
written in Shakespeare's own person, or in the character of another, or
of several others; to be autobiographical or heterobiographical or
allegorical; to have been addressed to Lord Southampton, to Sir William
Herbert, to his own wife, to Lady Rich, to his child, to himself, to his
Muse." The safest and wisest course seems to be, first to regard each of
the one hundred and fifty-four sonnets as a poem complete in itself, and
after studying whatever it may contain of art, or beauty, or truth, then
to discover, if possible, its relationship to those which precede or
follow it in the series.</p>

<p>Of the other poems written by Shakespeare, mention should be made of
"The Passionate Pilgrim" (1559), "The Phoenix and the Turtle" (1601), "A
Lover's Complaint," published in the same volume with the "Sonnets," and
the few exquisite little songs scattered through his plays.</p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>This is a selection from Spenser's great poem, "The Faerie Queene,"
being a part of the seventh canto of book second. "The Faerie Queene"
was published in 1590, and comprises six books of twelve cantos each.
The first book is the Legend of the Red Cross Knight, or Holiness; the
second, of Sir Guyon, or Temperance; the third, of Britomartis, or
Chastity; the fourth, of Cambel and Triamond, or Friendship; the fifth,
of Artegall, or Justice; the sixth, of Sir Calidore, or Courtesy. It was
Spenser's design that the complete work should contain twelve books, but
of the remaining part only a fragment of one book, the "Legend of
Constance," is in existence.</p>

<p>The versification of the "Faerie Queene" is based upon the <i>ottava
rima</i>, made so popular in Italian poetry by Tasso and Ariosto. Instead
of eight lines to a stanza, however, there are nine. The first eight
lines are iambic pentameters, and the ninth a hexameter, the stanza thus
closing with a lingering cadence which adds greatly to the melody of the
verse. This is the "Spenserian stanza," a form of versification very
popular with many of our later poets.</p>

<p>"If you love poetry well enough to enjoy it for its own sake," says
Leigh Hunt, "let no evil reports of his <i>allegory</i> deter you from an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[<a href="./images/233.png">233</a>]</span>acquaintance with Spenser, for great will be your loss. His allegory
itself is but one part allegory and nine parts beauty and enjoyment;

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>This poem was written and published towards the end of the year 1595.
The word <i>prothalamium</i> is from Gr. <i>pro</i>, for, and <i>thalamos</i>, a
bride-chamber, and would more properly be applied to a marriage-song
than to "a spousall verse." Spenser had already written&mdash;earlier in the
same year&mdash;the "Epithalamium" in honor of his own marriage. The singing
of a hymeneal song in connection with the wedding festivities was a very
ancient custom among the Greeks. Homer alludes to it in the "Iliad,"
XVIII, 493:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And two fair populous towns were sculptur'd there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">In one were marriage pomp and revelry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And brides, in gay procession, through the streets<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">With blazing torches from their chambers borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">While frequent rose the hymeneal song."<br /></span>

<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Edmund Spenser</span> was born in London about the year 1552. He was educated
at Merchant Taylor's school, and in 1569 went to Cambridge University,
where he entered Pembroke Hall as a sizar. In the same year his first
poetical performances&mdash;translations from Petrarch and Du Bellay&mdash;were
published in a miscellaneous collection without the name of the author.
At the University he was zealously devoted to the study of Latin and
Greek literature, and there he made the acquaintance of several students
who afterwards became men of note. In 1579 he visited Sir Philip Sidney
at Penshurst, with whom he afterwards spent some time in London at the
house of Sidney's uncle, the Earl of Leicester. In 1580 was published,
but without his name, his first considerable poem, "The Shepheards
Calendar"; and in the autumn of the same year he went to Ireland as
secretary to Lord Grey of Wilton, the new Lord Lieutenant. With the
exception of a few brief visits made to England, the remainder of his
life was spent partly in Dublin and partly at Kilcolman Castle on a
grant of forfeited land in the county of Cork. Between 1580 and 1589 he
wrote the first three books of "The Faerie Queene," and in 1590 they
were published in London, through the influence of Sir Walter Raleigh,
who had recently visited the poet in Ireland. In the summer of 1594 he
married a lady named Elizabeth, probably the daughter of some English
settler in Ireland; and in the following year he carried to London and
published the second three books of "The Faerie Queene." At about the
same time were published his "Colin Clout's Come Home Again," and his
"Amoretti Sonnets," and an "Epithalamium" relating to his courtship and
marriage. Returning to Ireland, he resumed his labor upon the
half-completed "Faerie Queene," but it was rudely <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>[<a href="./images/246.png">246</a>]</span>interrupted by the
breaking out of an insurrection among the Irish. In 1598 Spenser's house
was sacked and burned by the rebels, and it was with the greatest
difficulty that he and his family escaped with their lives. Indeed, it
is stated, on the authority of Ben Jonson, that one little child
perished in the flames. Spenser returned to London in poverty and great
distress, and on the 16th of January, 1599, he died in King Street,
Westminster. He was buried in the Abbey.</p>

<p>Spenser has been very appropriately named "the poets' poet." "For," says
Leigh Hunt, "he has had more idolatry and imitation from his brethren
than all the rest put together. The old undramatic poets, Drayton,
Browne, Drummond, and Giles and Phineas Fletcher, were as full of him as
the dramatic were of Shakespeare. Milton studied and used him, calling
him 'sage and serious Spenser'; and adding that he 'dared be known to
think him a better teacher than Scotus and Aquinas.' Cowley said he
became a poet by reading him. Dryden claimed him for a master. Pope said
he read him with as much pleasure when he was old as when he was young.
Collins and Gray loved him. Thomson, Shenstone, and a host of inferior
writers expressly imitated him. Burns, Byron, Shelley, and Keats made
use of his stanza. Coleridge eulogized him."</p>

<p>Hazlitt says, "Of all the poets, Spenser is the most poetical." And
Taine declares that no modern is more like Homer than he.</p>

<p>With reference to the peculiar forms of language&mdash;comparatively obsolete
even when "The Faerie Queene" was composed&mdash;which are so marked a
characteristic of Spenser's poetry, Hales says: "The subject he chose
for his great work drew him into the midst of the old times of chivalry,
and the literature that belonged to them. With such a subject the older
forms of the language seemed to consort better. To him, too, perhaps, as
to Virgil, the older words and word-forms seemed to give elevation and
dignity. Moreover, an older dialect was probably to some extent his
vernacular, as he had probably passed his youth in Lancashire. Lastly,
the only great poet who had preceded him, his great model, the Tityrus
of whom he 'his songs did lere,' was Chaucer. To him Chaucer's language
may have seemed the one language of English poetry."</p>

<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Wyatt</span> and <span class="smcap">Surrey</span> are usually named together as the most illustrious
poets of the earlier part of the sixteenth century. J. Churton Collins
calls them, not inaptly, "the Dioscuri of the Dawn." "They inaugurated,"
he says, "that important period in our literature known as the Era of
Italian Influence, or that of the Company of Courtly Makers&mdash;the period
which immediately preceded and ushered in the age of Spenser and
Shakespeare." It is to them that we are indebted for the sonnet: they
were indeed the founders of our lyrical poetry. Jonson, Herrick, Waller,
Cowley, and Suckling found inspiration in their ditties. Surrey's
translation of the second and fourth books of Virgil's "&AElig;neid" (1552) is
the earliest specimen of blank verse in our language.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Wyatt</span> was born at Allington Castle in 1503, and in his youth was
a prominent and very popular member of the court of Henry VIII. He was
knighted in 1536, and in 1537 became high sheriff of Kent. In April of
the same year he was sent as ambassador to Spain, and in 1539-40 was
with the court of Charles V. in the Low Countries. Returning to England
he lived for the next two years in retirement, and died at Sherborne in
1542.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey</span>, was born about 1517, and, like his friend
Wyatt, passed his youth at the court of Henry VIII. He served in France
in 1540, and again in 1544-46. After taking Boulogne, he became its
governor; but, on account of defeat soon afterwards at St. Etienne, he
was recalled to England by Henry VIII. His comments upon this action of
the king caused his arrest and imprisonment in the Tower. A charge of
high treason was preferred against him for having quartered the royal
arms with his own, and he was beheaded on Tower Hill, January 21, 1547.</p>

<p>"This is a very ancient song," says Bishop Percy, "but we can only give
it from a modern copy." It is often printed as part of a ballad relating
to the history of Lord James Douglas and of the Laird of Blackwood. The

those of Lord Douglas.</p>

<h3>NOTES AND GLOSSARY.</h3>

<p>This ballad in its original form is a very old one, and was probably at
first a metrical story of the Scotch expedition which was sent to bring
the Maid of Norway to Scotland (about the year 1285). In its
sixteenth-century <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>[<a href="./images/259.png">259</a>]</span>form it shows many changes and additions, some of
which are not in harmony with the original tale. The <i>cork-heel'd
shoon</i>, for example, were unknown until some hundreds of years later
than the occurrence of the events here narrated.</p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>Among the earliest and most popular of English ballads are those
relating to Robin Hood. This noted, half-mythical outlaw was the
impersonation of popular rights as they were understood by Englishmen of
the lower orders in the days of the Plantagenets. Hence the memory of
him and his reputed deeds was preserved in the songs of the people. "It
is he," says an old historian, "whom the common people love so dearly to
celebrate in games and comedies, and whose history, sung by fiddlers,
interests them more than any other." Even so late as the reign of Edward
VI., "Robyn Hoode's Daye" was very generally observed in the country
parishes as a day of feasting and amusement.</p>

<p>The ballads were originally the production of wandering minstrels or
gleemen, a class of men very popular in the Middle Ages, who followed
the profession of poetry and music. These rude poets were held in the
highest esteem and veneration by the people among whom they lived; they
were received and welcomed wherever they went, and even kings delighted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>[<a href="./images/266.png">266</a>]</span>to honor them. In short, their art was supposed, by the Anglo-Saxons,
to be of divine origin, having been invented by Odin, the great
All-Father, and perfected by Bragi, the musician of the gods. As,
however, civilization advanced and Christianity became established, this
admiration for the minstrel and his art became modified in a degree. He
was no longer regarded as a poet, but only as a singer, a sweet
musician. Poetry was cultivated by men of leisure and refinement; but
lyrical ballads remained the peculiar inheritance of the minstrel. For a
long time after the Norman conquest, minstrels continued to gain their
livelihood by singing in the houses of the great, and at festive
occasions, which were never considered complete unless graced by the
presence of these honored descendants of Bragi; nor did they cease to
compose and sing their inimitable pieces until near the close of
Elizabeth's reign. The greater number of the ballads now in existence
were probably produced during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; and
the best of them originated in the "North Country," or the border region
between England and Scotland. They were not at first reduced to writing,
but were handed down from one generation to another merely by oral
tradition. As regards their metre and versification, the ballads were
commonly composed of iambic hexameters or heptameters rhyming in
couplets. These couplets are readily broken into stanzas of four lines,
in which form they are usually printed.</p>

<p>The first collection of English ballads ever published was probably that
of John Dryden, in 1684. The collection was included in a volume
entitled <i>Miscellany Poems</i>. In 1723 a work called <i>A Collection of Old
Ballads</i> was published anonymously. In 1724 Allan Ramsay issued <i>The
Evergreen</i>, "being a collection of Scots Poems wrote by the Ingenious
before 1600." This work included many popular songs and ballads. It was
reprinted in 1875.</p>

<p>We owe the preservation of a large number of the most interesting and
beautiful ballads to Bishop Percy, who, in 1765, published the first
really valuable collection of such works in his <i>Reliques of Ancient
English Poetry</i>. Previous to that time most of these songs had existed
only in manuscript, or, if printed at all, in the cheapest style of
typography, on sheets designed for circulation among the poor. Bishop
Percy's work first called the attention of scholars to the value and
beauty of these neglected and half-forgotten relics, and did much to
bring about that revolution in literature which took place in the latter
part of the last century. And it is to these old ballads, thus rescued
from oblivion, that we owe very many of the noblest literary productions
of the present century. We know that they were the immediate inspiration
of Sir Walter Scott, and that they exerted a wonderful influence in
modifying and directing the taste and style of many other distinguished
writers.</p>

<h2>The Fifteenth Century.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<i>When we pass from Chaucer's age, we have to overleap nearly a hundred
and eighty years before we alight upon a period presenting anything like
an adequate show of literary continuation. A few smaller names are all
that can be cited as poetical representatives of this sterile interval
in the literary history of England: whatever of Chaucer's genius still
lingered in the island seeming to have travelled northward and taken
refuge in a series of Scotch poets, excelling any of their English
contemporaries. We are driven to suppose that there was something in the
social circumstances of England during the long period in question which
prevented such talent as there was from assuming the particular form of
literature. Fully to make out what this 'something' was may baffle us;
but, when we remember that this was the period of the Civil Wars of the
Roses, we have reason to believe that the dearth of pure literature may
have been owing, in part, to the engrossing nature of the practical
questions which then disturbed English society.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Accordingly, though
printing was introduced during this period, and thus Englishmen had
greater temptations to write, what they did write was almost exclusively
plain grave prose, intended for practical or polemical occasions, and
making no figure in a historical retrospect.</i>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">David Masson.</span></p>

<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">John Skelton</span> was born about the year 1460. In his earlier life he was
the friend of Caxton, the first English printer, and of Percy, Earl of
Northumberland. He was poet-laureate under Henry VII., and tutor of the
young prince (afterwards Henry VIII.), and was described by Erasmus as
<i>litterarum Anglicarum lumen et decus</i>. Later in life he was promoted to
the rectory of Diss in Norfolk, but was severely censured by his bishop
for his buffooneries in the pulpit and his satirical ballads against the
mendicants. He finally became a hanger-on about the court of Henry
VIII.; and, daring to write a rhyming libel on Cardinal Wolsey, was
driven to take refuge in the sanctuary of Westminster Abbey. There he
was kindly entertained and protected by Abbot Islip until his death in
1529. Some of his poems were printed in 1512, and others in 1568.</p>

<p>Taine calls Skelton "a virulent pamphleteer, who jumbles together
French, English, Latin phrases, with slang and fashionable words,
invented words, intermingled with short rhymes. Style, metre, rhyme,
language, art of every kind, at an end; beneath the vain parade of
official style there is only a heap of rubbish. Yet, as he says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Though my rhyme be ragged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Tatter'd and jagged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Rudely rain-beaten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Rusty, moth-eaten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Yf ye take welle therewithe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">It hath in it some pithe.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As to the coarseness which characterizes his verses, it cannot be
explained by saying that it is a reflection of the manners of the times
in which he lived. For, as Warton says, Skelton "would have been a
writer without decorum at any period." Yet, notwithstanding his faults,
he is deserving of our notice, if for nothing else, on account of the
complete originality of his style&mdash;a style unknown and unattempted by
any former writer. His bold departure from the accepted rules of
versification showed to those who followed him some of the possibilities
in English poetical composition, and helped to open the way to the great
outburst of song which followed.</p>

<h3>NOTE.</h3>

<p>This is a selection from the long allegorical poem, "The Thistle and the
Rose." The thistle represents Scotland, of which country that plant is
the national emblem. The fleur-de-lis, or lily, represents France; and
the rose, England. The poem was written in celebration of the marriage
of James IV. of Scotland to the Princess Margaret of England, and the
friendly relations thus established for a time between those two
countries.</p>

<h2>FOUR POETS OF THIS CENTURY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">John Lydgate</span> was born at the village of Lydgate, near Newmarket, about
1370. He was a Benedictine monk attached to the monastery of Bury St.
Edmunds, and is remembered as the author of three poems, which, in their
time, attracted much attention. These are "The Storie of Thebes,"
written in ten-syllable rhyming couplets, and founded upon the "Teseide"
of Boccaccio; the "Troye Book," finished about 1420, and relating the
story of the Trojan war as recounted by Guido di Colonna in his Latin
prose history of Troy; and "The Falls of Princes," founded on a French
version of Boccaccio's "De Casibus Virorum Illustrium." In 1433, Lydgate
wrote a wearisome but somewhat amusing poem, "Pur le Roy," describing a
visit to London, and the pageants, processions, and other rejoicings, on
the occasion of the entrance of Henry VI. into the city after his
coronation. The date of the poet's death is not exactly known, but it
was probably not later than 1440.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Robert Henryson</span>, "an accomplished man and a good and genuine poet," was
born about the year 1425, and died near the close of the century. He was
for a time a schoolmaster and notary public at Dunfermline, in Scotland,
and was connected, in some capacity, with the University of Glasgow. He
was probably, like Lydgate, a Benedictine monk. His principal works are
"The Testament of Cresseid," a sequel to Chaucer's "Troilus and
Cresseide," and a collection of thirteen fables. He wrote also many
shorter poems, of which the ballad of "Robin and Makyne" (published in
Percy's <i>Reliques</i>) is the best known.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">William Dunbar</span> was born in East Lothian, Scotland, about the year 1450.
He was educated at the University of St. Andrews, and in early life
travelled somewhat extensively as a novitiate of the order of St.
Francis. He visited England in 1501, upon the occasion of the marriage
of James IV. of Scotland to the Princess Margaret, daughter of Henry
VII. One of his best poems, "The Thistle and the Rose," was written in
commemoration of that event. He accompanied the queen to Aberdeen in
1511, and for some time, both before and after, was in attendance and
favor at the Scotch court. Nothing is known of his death, but it has
been conjectured <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>[<a href="./images/284.png">284</a>]</span>that he fell in the battle of Flodden, in 1513.
Besides the poem just mentioned, he wrote "The Golden Targe," "The Dance
of the Deadly Sins," and many shorter poems, most of which are
allegories. The "Thistle and the Rose" has been pronounced "the happiest
political allegory in our language. Heraldry has never been more
skilfully handled, nor compliments more gracefully paid, nor fidelity
more persuasively preached to a monarch than in this poem."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Gawain Douglas</span> was a son of the famous Earl of Angus, and was born in
Brechin, Scotland, about 1474. He was educated partly at the University
of St. Andrews, and partly in Paris. His first considerable poem, "The
Palice of Honour," was published in 1501, and dedicated to King James
IV. It is an allegory, such as was at that time the staple of poetical
composition, and contains but little that is particularly original.
Another allegory, printed after his death, is entitled "King Hart," and
has for its subject the heart of man. His greatest work is his
translation of Virgil's "&AElig;neid" into Scottish verse. In 1509, Douglas
was appointed provost of St. Giles, Edinburgh, and after the battle of
Flodden he was made abbot of Aberbrothwick. In 1515 he was consecrated
Bishop of Dunkeld, but was unable to gain possession of the cathedral
except by force. Becoming involved in the feud between the rival
families of Angus and Hamilton, he was obliged to escape into England in
1521, where towards the end of the same year he died.</p>

<h2>The Fourteenth Century.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<i>In the fourteenth century there comes an Englishman nourished on this
[the romance] poetry, taught his trade by this poetry, getting words,
rhyme, metre from this poetry; for even of that stanza which the
Italians used, and which Chaucer derived immediately from the Italians,
the basis and suggestion was probably given in France.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If we ask
ourselves wherein consists the immense superiority of Chaucer's poetry
over the [earlier] romance-poetry, why it is that in passing from this
to Chaucer we suddenly feel ourselves to be in another world, we shall
find that his superiority is both in the substance of his poetry and in
the style of his poetry. His superiority in substance is given by his
large, free, simple, clear yet kindly view of human life.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We have
only to call to mind the Prologue to 'The Canterbury Tales.' The right
comment upon it is Dryden's: 'It is sufficient to say, according to the
proverb, that </i>here is God's plenty<i>.' And again: 'He is a perpetual
fountain of good sense.' It is by a large, free, sound representation of
things, that poetry, this high criticism of life, has truth of
substance; and Chaucer's poetry has truth of substance. If we think of
Chaucer's divine liquidness of diction, his divine fluidity of movement,
it is difficult to speak temperately. They are irresistible, and justify
all the rapture with which his successors speak of his gold 'dew-drops
of speech.' .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Chaucer is the father of our splendid English poetry, he
is our 'well of English undefiled,' because by the lovely charm of his
diction, the lovely charm of his movement, he makes an epoch and founds
a tradition. In Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, Keats, we can follow the
tradition of the liquid diction, the fluid movement, of Chaucer; at one
time it is his liquid diction of which in these poets we feel the
virtue, and at another it is his fluid movement. And the virtue is
irresistible.</i>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Matthew Arnold.</span></p>

<h3>ON READING CHAUCER.</h3>

<p>"'How few there are who can read Chaucer so as to understand him
perfectly,' says Dryden, apologizing for 'translating' him. In our day,
with the wider spread of historical study, with the numerous helps to
Old English that the care of scholars has produced for us, with the
purification that Chaucer's text has undergone, this saying of Dryden's
ought not to be true. It ought to be not only possible, but easy, for an
educated reader to learn the few essentials of Chaucerian grammar, and
for an ear at all trained to poetry to tune itself to the unfamiliar
harmonies. For those who make the attempt the reward is certain. They
will gain the knowledge, not only of the great poet and creative genius,
but of the master who uses our language with a power, a freedom, a
variety, a rhythmic beauty, that, in five centuries, not ten of his
successors have been found able to rival."&mdash;<i>T. H. Ward.</i></p>

<p>The peculiarities of diction and grammar which distinguish Chaucer's
poetry seem to make its reading and comprehension difficult and often
discourage the student at the outset. A very little study, however, will
show that the difficulties in the way are not nearly so great as they at
first appear, and, after a little patient practice in reading, they will
disappear entirely. By observing the following rules you will soon
acquire the ability to read with a fluency which will be highly pleasing
to you:</p>

<p>1. Final <i>e</i> should be pronounced as a separate syllable whenever the
metre demands it.</p>

<p>2. In all words of French origin, such as vis&aacute;ge, cor&aacute;ge, mani&eacute;r, the
final syllable is accented.</p>

<p>The greatest difficulty in reading Chaucer arises from the antiquated
manner in which the words are spelled; but if the reader will change an
occasional <i>y</i> to <i>i</i>, and drop a final <i>e</i> or a final <i>n</i>, here and
there, the words which seemed at first so strange will appear more
familiar to the eye and the understanding.</p>


<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey Chaucer</span>, "the morning-star of English poetry," was born in
London in 1328,&mdash;according to some authorities, in 1340. He was the son
of a vintner, and at an early age became acquainted with many persons of
distinction. He was a page in the household of Prince Lionel, and
afterwards valet and squire to Edward III. In 1372 he was sent abroad as
a royal envoy, and on his return he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>[<a href="./images/302.png">302</a>]</span>was made Controller of the Customs
In London. In the meantime he had married Philippa Rouet, one of the
queen's maids of honor, a sister to the wife of John of Gaunt. Being
thus closely related to one of the most powerful members of the royal
family, he was often employed in important and honorable commissions
connected with the government. In 1386 he was member of Parliament for
Kent, and in 1389 was appointed Clerk of the King's Works, at Windsor.
He died in 1400, and was buried in Westminster Abbey,&mdash;"the first of the
long line of poets whose ashes make that edifice illustrious." His
poetical history has been divided by Mr. Furnivall into four periods:
(1) up to 1371, during which he wrote the "A B C" the "Compleynte to
Pit&eacute;," the "Boke of the Duchesse," and the "Compleynte of Mars"; (2)
from 1372 to 1381, which saw the production of "Troylus and Criseyde,"
"Anelida," and the "Former Age"; (3) from 1381 to 1389, during which his
best works appeared, the "Parlament of Foules," the "House of Fame," the
"Legende of Goode Women," and some of the "Canterbury Tales"; (4) from
1389 to the close of his life, in which period the remainder of the
"Canterbury Tales" and some short poems were written.</p>

<p>M. Taine says, "Chaucer is like a jeweller with his hands full; pearls
and glass beads, sparkling diamonds and common agates, black jet and
ruby roses, all that history and imagination had been able to gather and
fashion during three centuries in the East, in France, in Wales, in
Provence, in Italy, all that had rolled his way, clashed together,
broken or polished by the stream of centuries, and by the grand jumble
of human memory, he holds in his hand, arranges it, composes therefrom a
long sparkling ornament, with twenty pendants, a thousand facets, which
by its splendor, variety, contrasts, may attract and satisfy the eyes of
those most greedy for amusement and novelty."</p>
